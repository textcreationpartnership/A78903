            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Seneca <hi>indeed comforts his friend</hi> Polybius, <hi>and perſwades him to bear his afflictions patiently, becauſe hee was</hi> the Emperours Favourite, <hi>and tells him,</hi> That it was not lawful for him to complain, while <hi>Caeſar</hi> was his <note place="margin">Fas tibi non eſt de fortuna conqueri ſalvo Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare.</note> friend<hi>: But this was but a</hi> poor Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: <hi>For</hi> Caeſar <hi>himſelf a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was ſo miſerable, that hee had not a friend to help him, much leſſe was hee able to help his friend.

               <note place="margin">Fas tibi non eſt de fortuna conqueri ſalvo Deo, &amp; ſalvis promiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Dei.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>My purpoſe at firſt was only to have printed the Sermon preached at</hi> Mris. Moores <hi>Funeral, together with her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences for Heaven, collected by her in the time of her health. But the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of friends hath overſwayed mee, and cauſed mee to adde four more, preached immediately afterwards on the ſame Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now (Dearly Beloved) having this fair opportunity to ſpeak to you in writing, give mee leave to propound and lay before you ſome</hi> cautions and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions; <hi>ſome</hi> Rules <hi>and</hi> Directions <hi>for the right ordering of your lives and converſations in theſe dangerous and divided times, that ſo you may bee able after my deceaſe, to have them in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual remembrance.</hi>

Faith <hi>and</hi> Repentance <hi>are the two great</hi> Goſpel-graces: <hi>And the reaſon why ſo many miſcarry to all eternity, is not for</hi> want <hi>of them (ſuch as they are) but upon a</hi> pure miſtake, <hi>in thinking they have them, when they have but a</hi> ſhadow of them. <hi>Where one goeth to Hell by</hi> deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>hundreds go thither by</hi> preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And yet 'tis not my opinion that every member of a Congregation is bound to know every</hi> fellow-member. <hi>I beleeve it was not ſo in the</hi> Church of Jeruſalem, <hi>or of</hi> Samaria. <hi>It is</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, <hi>to think that they all knew one another.

That every maid-ſervant, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant is bound to know, and to bee acquainted with all thoſe with whom they communicate in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <hi>Indeed the</hi> Church-officers <hi>are</hi> the eyes <hi>of the people, and are to know all, and to bee acquainted with all: But yet notwithſtanding this, I ſay, It is the duty of every</hi> member, <hi>to endeavour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his</hi> place and calling, <hi>to grow up in ſpiritual acquaintance one with another, as</hi> God <hi>ſhall offer occaſion, and not to be ſo ſtrange and unacquainted, but to</hi> walk in love one towards another, to bear one anothers burden, and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2.</p>

The word <hi>Law</hi> is taken diverſly in Scripture, ſometimes for the <hi>Moral Law, James</hi> 2.10.

By Law in this place is meant, all thoſe Books of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which were written when this Pſalm was penned. But I ſhall handle it in a larger ſenſe, as it comprehends all the Books both of the Old and New Teſtament. For the word <hi>Law</hi> is ſometimes alſo taken for the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as it is <hi>Micah</hi> 4.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3.

               <p>One Truth clearly propoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Law of God delighted in, is the afflicted Saints Antidote againſt ruine, and deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Two Truths ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this:</p>
               <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That the beſt of Gods Saints are in this life ſubject to many great and tedious afflictions.</hi>

                  <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods own heart, and yet hee was a man made up of troubles of all ſorts and ſizes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as hee profeſſeth of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Save mee, O God, for the waters are come in unto my ſoul, I ſinke in deep mire where there is no ſtanding, I am come into deep waters, where the flouds over-flow mee; I am weary of my crying, my throat is dryed, mine eyes</hi>

                  <hi>fail while I wait for my God.</hi> And in this Text hee profeſſeth that his afflictions were ſo great, that hee muſt neceſſarily have periſhed under them, had hee not been ſuſtained by the powerful comforts hee fetched out of the word. There is an emphaſis in the word <hi>Then,</hi> I ſhould <hi>then</hi> have periſhed. That is, long before this time, <hi>then, when</hi> I was afflicted, then I ſhould have periſhed. <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it, <hi>Jam diu periiſſem, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhould long ago have periſhed. <hi>Job</hi> was a man <hi>eminent</hi> for godlineſs, and yet as eminent for afflictions.

               <p>Queſt. <hi>But why doth God afflict his own children with ſuch variety of long and great afflictions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. God doth not do this, becauſe hee <hi>hates</hi> them, but becauſe hee <hi>loves</hi> them, <hi>For whom the Lord lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth hee chaſtiſeth, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 12.6. Did the Lord hate them, hee would ſuffer them to go merrily to hel. <hi>There is no ſurer ſign of Gods reprobating anger, than to ſuffer a man to proſper in wicked courſes.</hi> God threatneth this as the <hi>greateſt puniſhment, not to puniſh them,</hi> Hoſ. 4.14. And therefore becauſe God loveth his children, <hi>hee chaſtiſeth them in this world, that they may not bee condemned in the world to come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.33.</p>
               <p>2 God doth not do this, becauſe hee would <hi>hurt</hi> them, but for their <hi>good, Jer.</hi> 24 5. The <hi>good figs</hi> were ſent into captivity for their <hi>good.</hi> Heb. 12.10

               <p>1 Gods deſign is to teach us to <hi>know him,</hi> and <hi>to truſt in him,</hi> and <hi>to know our ſelves.</hi> It is a true ſaying of <hi>Luther, Schola crucis, eſt Schola lucis,</hi> the School of <hi>Affliction</hi> is a School of <hi>Inſtruction;</hi> Gods <gap reason="foreign">

goodneſſe and mercy; For <hi>God</hi> doth ſo <hi>ſweeten</hi> the bitter cup of affliction, that a child of God doth many times taſte more of Gods love in one months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, than in many years of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4, 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 4. Adde to this. Afflictions teach us to know God <hi>Experimentally</hi> and affectionative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not <hi>cerebraliter</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith) but <hi>cordialiter,</hi> ſo to know him, as to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> him, and to <hi>flye</hi> unto him as our rock and hiding-place in the day of our diſtreſs. It is ſaid, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1. By <hi>night I ſought him whom my ſoul loveth, &amp;c.</hi> Some by the word <hi>Night,</hi> underſtand the night of divine deſertion, and from the words <hi>Gilbertus</hi> hath this ſaying; <hi>Qui quaerit in nocte, non quaerit ut videat, ſed ut amplectatur;</hi> Hee that ſeeks after God in the night of adverſity, doth not ſeek to ſee him, and know him formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſuperficially, but to imbrace him, and to love him really and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<hi>:</hi> And therefore the Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver left till ſhee had <hi>found Chriſt,</hi> and

when ſhee had found him, <hi>ſhe held him,</hi> and would not let him go, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Not only to know God, but alſo <hi>to truſt in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 9. <hi>Wee had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that wee ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God, which raiſeth the dead.</hi> Note here, 1 That an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is apt in time of proſperity, to truſt in himſelf. 2 That God brings his children to the gates of death, that they might learn not to truſt in themſelves, but in God, which <hi>raiſeth the dead,</hi> that is, from a dead and deſperate condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Not only to know God, but to <hi>know our ſelves,</hi> which two are the chiefe parts of Chriſtian religion: It is ſaid of the Prodigal, that when hee was in adverſity, then hee <hi>came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Luk. 15. 17. <hi>And when hee came to himſelf.</hi> He was <hi>ſpiritually diſtracted,</hi> when hee was in <hi>proſperity:</hi> Afflictions teach us to know that wee are but <hi>men,</hi> according to that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſa.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170160:27"/>
9. 2. <hi>Put them in fear O Lord, that they may know themſelves to bee but men. Caligula</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> who in proſperity would bee called Gods, when it thundred from Heaven, were ſo terrified, that then they knew they were but men. In proſperity wee forget our mortality. Adverſity cauſeth us to know, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that wee are men, but frail men, that God hath us <hi>between his hands,</hi> (as it is <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 17.) and can as eaſily cruſh us, as wee do moths; That wee are in <hi>Gods hands, as the Clay in the hands of the Potter:</hi> That hee hath an abſolute ſoveraignty over us, and that wee depend upon him for our being, wel-being, and eternal being. Theſe things wee know feelingly and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in the day of affliction. And it much concerns us to know theſe things, and to know them powerfully. For this will make us ſtand in awe of God, and ſtudy to ſerve and pleaſe him. Hee that depends upon a man
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170160:27"/>
for his livelihood, knowing that hee hath him at an advantage, and can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undo him, will certainly indeavour to comply with him, and to obtain his favour. <hi>The ground of all ſervice and obedience is dependence.</hi> And did wee really and experimentally know our dependence upon God, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages hee hath us at, wee could not, wee would not but comply with him, and labour above all things to gain his love and favour.</p>
               <p>2 Gods aim in afflicting his children, <note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> is either to <hi>keep them from ſin,</hi> or when they have ſinned, <hi>to bring them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for it, and from it.</hi>

               <p n="5">5 Gods deſign in afflicting his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is to <hi>prove,</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> their graces.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To <hi>prove their graces,</hi> Rev. 2. 10. Deut. 8. 2. to prove the <hi>truth,</hi> and the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of them. 1 The <hi>truth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their graces;</hi> For this cauſe hee loaded <hi>Job</hi> with afflictions, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee ſerved God for his Cammels,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170160:30"/>
and Oxen, or for love to God. As <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons ſword</hi> tried the true <hi>Mother</hi> from the <hi>falſe;</hi> So the <hi>ſword</hi> of affliction diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the ſincere Chriſtian from the Hypocrite. Diſtreſſes are <hi>divine touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones,</hi> to try whether wee bee true or counterfeit Saints; <hi>That grace is true, which upon tryal is found true.</hi> 2 To try the <hi>ſtrength of our graces.</hi> For it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a ſtrong faith to indure great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. That Faith which will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for a <hi>little</hi> affliction, will not ſuffice for a <hi>great</hi> one. <hi>Peter</hi> had faith enough to come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the <hi>Sea,</hi> but aſſoon as the <hi>ſtorm began</hi> to ariſe, his <hi>Faith</hi> began to fail, and Chriſt ſaid. <hi>Why art thou afratd, O thou of little Faith?</hi> Matth. 14. 30, 31. It muſt bee a <hi>ſtrong Faith</hi> that muſt keep us from ſinking in the day of <hi>great diſtreſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 To <hi>improve our graces.</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the <hi>Lioneſſe,</hi> that ſhee leaves her young ones, till they have almoſt killed themſelves with roaring and howling, and then at laſt gaſpe, ſhee
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170160:31"/>
relieves them, and by this means they become more couragious. So God brings his children into the deeps, and ſuffers <hi>Jonah</hi> to bee three daies and three nights in the belly of the Whale, and <hi>David,</hi> to cry till his <hi>throat was dry,</hi> Pſa. 69. 3. and ſuffers his Apoſtles to bee all the night in a great ſtorm, till the fourth watch, and then hee comes and rebukes the winds, and by this means hee mightily increaſeth their <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>dependence</hi> upon God, and their Faith in Chriſt. As the <hi>Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> the more it is depreſſed, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſtronger, and fruitfuller it growes; So doth the graces of Gods people.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Gods aim in afflicting his people, is to <hi>put an edge upon their prayers, and all their other holy ſervices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Upon <hi>Prayer:</hi> What a famous Prayer did <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> make, when hee was under his iron fetters. It is thrice mentioned, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 13, 18, 19. When <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtruck off his horſe, and ſtruck with blindneſs, then hee
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170160:31"/>
prayed to purpoſe. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>Behold hee prayeth!</hi> In proſperity wee pray heavily and drowſily, but adverſity adds wings to our prayers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 16. The very heathen Marriners cryed aloud to God in a ſtorm. It is an ordinary ſaying, <hi>Qui neſcit or are diſcat navigate.</hi> There are no Saylors ſo wicked, but they will pray when in a great ſtorm.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Upon <hi>Preaching.</hi> Proſperity glutteth the ſpiritual appetite, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity whetteth it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Upon a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> How ſweet is a Sacrament to a true Saint after a long and great ſickneſs?</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>It makes God, and the word of God precious.</hi> If God ſets our Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields on fire (as <hi>Abſolom</hi> did <hi>Joabs)</hi> then hee ſhall bee ſure to cauſe us to come running to him; And how ſweet is a Text of Scripture to a childe of God in the hour of his diſtreſs?</p>
               <p>By all this it appears that God afflicts his children not to <hi>hurt them,</hi> but to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170160:32"/>
                  <hi>help them,</hi> and that God hath many glorious and gracious ends and aimes in afflicting of them. Therefore it is that <hi>David</hi> ſaith of himſelf in the 71. verſe of this <hi>Pſalm; It is good for mee that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy ſtatutes.</hi> Hee never ſaid, It is good for mee that I have been in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; but hee rather ſaith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the 67. verſe. <hi>Before I were afflicted I went aſtray, but now I have kept thy word. Gods people</hi> will bleſſe God as much (if not more) in <hi>Heaven,</hi> for their <hi>adverſity,</hi> than for their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.</hi>
               </p>

Act. 28. 4. <hi>When they ſaw the venimous beaſt hang upon the hands of</hi> Paul, <hi>they ſaid among themſelves, no doubt this man is a murderer, &amp;c.</hi> But remember they were <hi>Barbarians.</hi> It is a ſign of a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> not of a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> to paſs a raſh cenſure upon perſons in affliction. Think you (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that thoſe eighteen upon whom the Tower in</hi> Siloan <hi>fell and ſlew them, that they were ſinners above all men that dwelt in</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. <hi>I tell you, nay; but except you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: yee ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luk. 13. 4, 5. Think you that they which have the ſtone and gout in extreamity, that have cancers in their faces, and breaſts, are greater ſinners than others. I tell you, nay, &amp;c. For my part, if I would cenſure any, it ſhould bee ſuch as live wickedly, and meet with no affliction. Theſe have the <hi>black brand</hi> of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them. Theſe are men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to damnation. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> would not tarry a night in the houſe of a Gentleman that had never in all his

But when I ſee a godly woman afflicted, then I ſay, this is not ſo much for her ſin, as for her tryal; this is not to <hi>hurt her,</hi> but to <hi>teach</hi> her to know God, and to know her ſelf, to break her heart for Sin, and from ſin, to make the world bitter, and Chriſt ſweet. God hath put her into the fire of affliction, to refine her, and make her a veſſel fit for his uſe. God is ſtriking her with the hammer of affliction, that ſhee may bee ſquared, and made ready to bee laid in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2 Here is <hi>rich comfort</hi> to the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God</hi> under the <hi>greateſt afflictions.</hi> For the beſt of Saints are ſubject to the worſt afflictions: This is the lot of all Gods children, Chriſt himſelf not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. <hi>Afflictions</hi> (indeed) conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their own nature, are evil things, and ſo are called, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 13. They are part of the curſe due to ſin, the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170160:33"/>
fruit of Gods revenging wrath; they are as a biting and ſtinging Serpent. And to a wicked man, remaining wicked, they are the beginning of Hell: <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified afflictions parboil a wicked man for hell and damnation.</hi> But now to a child of God, they have loſt both their <hi>name,</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> they are not <hi>puniſhments</hi> properly, but <hi>chaſtiſements,</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, They are not <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> but <hi>caſtigatory.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath taken away the <hi>sting of theſe Serpents;</hi> they are not <hi>fiery,</hi> but brazen Serpents, they have a <hi>healing,</hi> not a <hi>hurting</hi> power. Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the curſe, &amp; bitterneſs of them; as the wood ſweetned the <hi>waters of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> Exod. 15. 25. So <hi>Chriſts Croſs</hi> hath ſweetned the <hi>bitterneſſe</hi> of afflictions.</p>
               <p>There are eight comfortable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, to chear the heart of a childe of God in the day of his diſtreſſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 God never afflicts his people, but out of <hi>pure neceſsity,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 6. <hi>though now for a ſeaſon, if need bee, yee are in Heavineſſe.</hi> 1 As a moſt loving <hi>Father,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:170160:34"/>
never corrects his childe, but when hee is forced to it. Hee willingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for his childe, but puniſheth him unwillingly. So <hi>God</hi> freely <hi>loadeth</hi> with his bleſſings, but hee never <hi>chaſtiſeth</hi> his children, but when <hi>forced</hi> to it, therefore hee ſaith expreſly, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 33. <hi>hee doth not afflict willingly,</hi> Iſa. 27. 1. <hi>Fury is not in mee.</hi> It is wee that put thunderbolts in Gods hand. If the Sun did not firſt draw up the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours from the earth, there would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee any thundering or lightening. God would never thunder from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his judgements, if our ſins did not firſt cry to Heaven for puniſhment. As <hi>Chriſt whipt</hi> the ſellers of Oxen and Sheep out of the Temple with a <hi>whip made</hi> (in all probability) <hi>of their own cords;</hi> So <hi>God</hi> never ſcourgeth us, but it is with a whip made of our own ſins, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5.<hi>—thou treaſureſt up to thy ſelf, &amp;c.</hi> God hath a <hi>double trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> a <hi>treaſure of mercy,</hi> and a <hi>treaſure of wrath;</hi> his <hi>treaſure of mercy,</hi> is alwaies
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170160:34"/>
full, but his <hi>treaſure of wrath</hi> is empty, till wee fill it by our ſins. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God puniſheth his children, hee calls it a <hi>ſtrange work,</hi> and a <hi>ſtrange act,</hi> Iſa. 28. 21. It is obſerved of the Bee, that it never ſtings, but when provoked; Sure I am, that God never afflicts his children, but out of pure neceſſity,</p>
               <p>2 Not only out of <hi>pure neceſsity,</hi> but out of true and real love; as I have ſhewed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Do not divine afflictions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of anger? was not God angry with</hi> Moſes <hi>for ſpeaking unadviſedly with his lips? and angry with</hi> David <hi>for his adultery, and thereupon afflicted both of them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This anger was a Fatherly anger, rooted in love; It was not <hi>ira quae reprobat,</hi> but <hi>ira quae purgat:</hi> It was not <hi>ira hostilis &amp; exterminativa,</hi> but <hi>ira paterna &amp; medicinalis.</hi> As it is a great puniſhment, for God ſometimes not to puniſh, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 14.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170160:35"/>
So it is a great mercy, ſometimes for God to withdraw his mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Afflictions are a part of <hi>divine prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination.</hi> That God which hath <hi>elected</hi> us to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> hath alſo <hi>elected us unto afflictions,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 3. <hi>That no man ſhould bee moved by theſe afflictions: for you your ſelves know, that wee are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto.</hi> The ſame love with which God elects us, and beſtoweth Chriſt, and his ſpirit upon us, with the very ſame love hee afflicts us.</p>
               <p n="4">4 They are part of the <hi>gracious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> which God hath made with his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 31, 32, 33. In which words wee have three things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>

               <p>1 Let us <hi>expect Afflictions;</hi> for Chriſt hath ſaid expreſly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. <hi>In the world yee ſhall have tribulation.</hi> There is in every child of God,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Sufficiens Fundamentum,</hi> A <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Foundation</hi> for God to buld a <hi>houſe of correction</hi> upon<hi>:</hi> There is ſin enough to deſerve affliction.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There is <hi>ſufficiens Motivum, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſufficient</hi> to prevail with God, to chaſtize them when they ſin againſt him; ſome of theſe you have heard already, let mee adde one more. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is more <hi>diſhonoured</hi> by the ſins of his own children, than by the ſins of wicked men<hi>:</hi> As it is a greater diſcredit to an <hi>earthly Father,</hi> when his own children, than when other mens children live wickedly; ſo it is a <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſparagement</hi> to our <hi>heavenly Father,</hi> when his own Sons and Daughters, than when the Devils children tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170160:37"/>
his Law<hi>:</hi> And therefore God will chaſtize them <hi>ſooner, ſurer,</hi> and <hi>more</hi> than others. 1 <hi>Sooner,</hi> Rom. 2. 9. <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile.</hi> Firſt the Jew, and then the Gentile. 2 <hi>Surer</hi> than others, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> 3 <hi>More</hi> than others, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>The puniſhment of the iniquity of the Daughter of my people, is greater than the puniſhment of the ſin of Sodom, &amp;c.</hi> Dan. 9. 12. <hi>under the whole Heaven hath not been done, as hath been done upon Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 There is <hi>ſufficiens neceſsitas, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient neceſſity</hi> to provoke God to afflict them. It is <hi>needful</hi> that the <hi>Wheat</hi> be winnowed, that ſo the chaffe may bee ſeparated from it. It is <hi>needful</hi> that the <hi>Wind</hi> blow upon the <hi>Wheat,</hi> to cleanſe it, and that <hi>Gold</hi> bee put into the furnace, to purge and purifie it.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170160:38"/>
When the <hi>Sheep of Chriſt</hi> are divided one from the other in judgement, and affections, when ſeparated in <hi>Doctrin, worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> It is very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that God ſhould ſend afflictions and diſtreſſes, which may bee (as the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearas dog)</hi> very ſerviceable and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, to unite them together, and to <hi>gather</hi> them into one <hi>Sheepfold.</hi> And therefore let the Saints of God expect afflictions.</p>

               <p>1 <hi>A ſtock of graces.</hi> For ſickneſſe is a <note place="margin">1 A ſtock of graces.</note> time to <hi>ſpend grace,</hi> but not to <hi>get grace.</hi> A <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in ſickneſſe <hi>without grace,</hi> is like a <hi>ſouldier</hi> in warre <hi>without armour,</hi> like a <hi>houſe</hi> in ſtormy weather without a foundation, and like the men of the old world, when ready to bee drowned without an Ark. Woe bee to that perſon that hath his <hi>graces</hi> to get, when hee ſhould <hi>uſe</hi> them<hi>!</hi> And therefore if wee would bee comforted in the day
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170160:38"/>

               <p n="1">1 A <hi>true Faith,</hi> (for a <hi>painted Faith</hi> will avail no more than a <hi>painted helmet,</hi> or a <hi>painted ſhip)</hi> and not only a <hi>True,</hi> but alſo a <hi>ſtrong Faith.</hi> A little faith will faint under great afflictions; when the winds began to blow fiercely, <hi>Peters</hi> little Faith began to fail, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 30. 2 <hi>A great meaſure of patience</hi> to inable us to wait <hi>quietly,</hi> and contentedly, till God come in with help, for many times hee tarrieth till the fourth watch of the night, as hee did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 25. And therefore wee have need of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to keep us from murmuring or repining.</p>
               <p>3 A great <hi>ſtock of Self-denial, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, repentance, contempt of the world, and heavenly-mindedneſſe.</hi> Hee that is furniſhed with grace in an evil hour, will bee as ſafe and ſecure, as <hi>Noah</hi> was in the Ark, in the time of the deluge, or as thoſe-were who had ſufficiency of corn in the time of the ſeven years

3 <hi>A ſtock of divine experiences.</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <note place="margin">3 A ſtock of divine experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> is that man that lodgeth up in his heart all the former experiences hee hath had of Gods love and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and knoweth how to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from them in the day of calamity; Thus did <hi>Moſes</hi> in his prayer to God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Pardon I beſeech thee the iniquity of this people, according unto the greatneſſe of thy mercy, and as thou haſt forgiven this people from Egypt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven until now.</hi> Becauſe God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them, therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> intreats him to forgive them; this argument is drawn from former experience. And thus <hi>David</hi> incourageth himſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 37. <hi>The Lord hath delivered mee out of the paw of the Lion, and out of the paw of the Bear, and hee will deliver mee out of the hand of this Philiſtine.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoneth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver, and in whom wee truſt that hee will yet deliver us!</hi> Divine experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are the Saints great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <p n="4">4 <hi>A ſtock of Sermons.</hi> Wee muſt do <note place="margin">4 A ſtock of ſermons</note> with Sermons, as the Trades-men do with the mony they get; ſome of it they lay out for their preſent uſe, and ſome of it they lay up againſt the time of ſickneſſe. That man is an ill huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and an unthrifty trades-man that makes no proviſion for old age; or for an evil day; and that man is an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table hearer of the word, who doth not ſtock and ſtore himſelf with Sermons, whereby hee may bee comforted in the hour of affliction. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> adviſeth us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 23. <hi>to hear for the time to come,</hi> or (as it is in the Hebrew) <hi>for the after-time.</hi> Sermons are not only to bee heard for our preſent uſe, but to bee laid up for after-times, that when wee lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſick-beds, and cannot hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, we may then live upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons wee have heard.</p>

What theſe promiſes are, you ſhall hear afterwards: Theſe upheld <hi>David</hi> in the hour of his diſtreſſe, and therefore hee ſaith in the Text, <hi>Unleſſe thy Law had been my delight, I had periſhed in mine affliction.</hi> If this our <hi>dear Siſter</hi> had not had this <hi>ſtock,</hi> ſhee had been quite <hi>overwhelmed</hi> under the grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her tormenting pains.

               <p>3 As wee muſt expect and provide for afflictions, ſo alſo wee muſt labour <note place="margin">3 Gods people are to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> (when afflicted) <hi>to improve them for our ſpiritual benefit and advantage,</hi> Wee muſt pray more for the ſanctification of them, than for their removal: It

was not the <hi>ſtaffe</hi> of <hi>Eliſha</hi> that revived the dead child, but <hi>Eliſha</hi> himſelf.

                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:170160:41"/>
                  <hi>more effectually,</hi> that thereby we may bee more <hi>purified and refined,</hi> that the <hi>wind</hi> of <hi>temptation</hi> may <hi>cleanſe</hi> us from the <hi>chaffe</hi> of our <hi>corruption,</hi> that wee may <hi>learn righteouſneſs</hi> by Gods <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and bee made <hi>partakers</hi> of his <hi>holineſſe.</hi> Such a good Scholar was <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes,</hi> hee got more good by his <hi>Iron chain,</hi> than by his <hi>Golden chain:</hi> Such another was the <hi>Prodigal child,</hi> who was <hi>happier</hi> amongſt the <hi>Swine,</hi> than when in his <hi>Fathers houſe;</hi> Such was <hi>Paul,</hi> his being <hi>ſtrucken</hi> down to the ground, <hi>raiſed</hi> him up to Heaven, by the <hi>blindneſſe</hi> of his body, his ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>ſight,</hi> and hee was turned from a perſecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> to a perſecuted <hi>Paul.</hi> Such another was <hi>David,</hi> who profeſſeth of himſelf, that <hi>it was good for him that hee was afflicted;</hi> and ſuch Scholars ought wee to bee.</p>
               <p>There are ſome that are <hi>arrant dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in this School, that are like unto the <hi>buſh</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw, which burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fire, but was not conſumed;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170160:42"/>
the fire did not conſume the thorny buſh. Many ſuch <hi>thorny</hi> ſinners are burnt up with the fire of divine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but their ſins are not conſumed. Of theſe the Prophets complain, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.<hi>—yet they have not returned, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 5.3. <hi>Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved; thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction; they have made their faces harder than a rock, they have refuſed to return.</hi> Rocks and ſtones by hewing and poliſhing may bee made fit for a building: But there are ſome men who by no afflictions will be amended. <hi>The Mountains melt at the preſence of the Lord, and the rocks rend aſunder, when hee is angry:</hi> But there are ſome that have made their <hi>faces harder</hi> than the <hi>Rocks,</hi> and the <hi>Mountains,</hi> and are not at all affected with Gods anger. Of ſuch as theſe <hi>Bernard</hi> complains. <hi>Multi humiliati, pauci humiles, corripimur, ſed not corrigimur, plectimur, ſed non flectimur; Multo facilius fregeris, quam</hi>

               <p>There are others that are the <hi>worſe for their afflictions,</hi> like the <hi>Smiths Anvil,</hi> the more they are ſtrucken, the harder they are<hi>:</hi> Such a one was King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 Chron. 28. 22. <hi>In the time of his diſtreſſe hee did treſpaſſe yet more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord:</hi> There is a brand put upon him<hi>—This is that King</hi> Ahaz, that wicked King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that reprobate King <hi>Ahaz.</hi> As Pearls put in Vinegar loſe their colour and beauty, ſo many, when under Gods hand, loſe all their glory and excellency, and begin to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt Gods providence, to call his juſtice into queſtion, to murmure and repine againſt Gods dealings, and to uſe unlawful means for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Of theſe the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complains, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Why ſhould you bee ſtricken any more? yee will revolt more and more;</hi> Such was <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> a King.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170160:43"/>
1.2. that ſought for help from <hi>Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub the god of Ekron;</hi> and ſuch was <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſought to the Witch of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> for health in the day of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Both of <hi>theſe</hi> ſorts are in a ſad and miſerable condition; For God hath <hi>two furnaces,</hi> the <hi>furnace of affliction,</hi> and the <hi>Furnace of hell-fire.</hi> If the firſt Furnace will not purge us, the ſecond will everlaſtingly conſume us. As the <hi>Roman Conſuls</hi> had a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to go before them, carrying <hi>a Rod</hi> and an <hi>Axe;</hi> A <hi>Rod</hi> for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of <hi>corrigible offenders,</hi> an <hi>Axe</hi> for the deſtruction of <hi>incorrigible;</hi> So God hath his <hi>Rod,</hi> and his <hi>Axe,</hi> his <hi>Pruning-knife,</hi> and his <hi>Chopping-knife,</hi> his <hi>Warning-peeces,</hi> and his <hi>Murdering-peeces.</hi> Afflictions are his <hi>Rods</hi> to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us for our ſin, his <hi>Pruning-knife</hi> to pare off our luxuriant branches; his <hi>Warning-peeces</hi> to call upon us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
               <p>But if his <hi>Warning-peeces</hi> will do
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170160:43"/>
us no good, wee muſt expect his <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering-peeces.</hi> If his <hi>Pruning-knife</hi> will not amend us, his <hi>Chopping-knife</hi> will confound us. If his <hi>Rods</hi> will not reclaim us, then his <hi>Axe</hi> will hew us down, and caſt us into everlaſting fire. God hath <hi>three houſes,</hi> the <hi>houſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> of <hi>Correction,</hi> and of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> The place where Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple meet to hear his word, is his <hi>houſe</hi> of <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> And if wee profit in this houſe, he will never carry us unto the <hi>houſe of Correction.</hi> But if wee bee ſtubborn and rebellious in the <hi>houſe of Inſtruction,</hi> then hee will ſend us to the <hi>houſe of Correction.</hi> And if wee profit in this houſe, hee will never ſend us into the <hi>houſe of Deſtruction.</hi> But if wee continue incorrigible in the <hi>houſe of Correction,</hi> hee will inevitably ſend us to the <hi>houſe of Deſtruction,</hi> that is, unto hell fire.</p>
               <p>And therefore whenſoever God brings us into the School of Affliction, let us labour to bee good Schollars
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170160:44"/>
in it; and to anſwer all thoſe ends, aimes, and deſigns which God hath in afflicting of us. Let us pray to God that our afflictions may bee <hi>Divine Hammers,</hi> to break our hearts for ſin, and from ſin, may make the <hi>world bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt more precious,</hi> may <hi>prove,</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> our graces, and may put an <hi>edge</hi> upon all holy duties.</p>

               </list>
               <p>1 You muſt labour to <hi>know the meaning of Gods Rod,</hi> and what the <hi>particular arrant</hi> is, which hee hath to you in the day of your diſtreſſes, you muſt do as <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1. hee inquired of the Lord <hi>to know the reaſon why hee ſent a Famine amongſt them.</hi> So muſt you, you muſt pray

as <hi>Job</hi> doth, <hi>Job</hi> 10. 2. <hi>Shew mee, O Lord, wherefore thou contendeſt with mee?</hi> When the cauſe of a diſeaſe is found out, it is half cured.

That the <hi>Rod hath a voyce,</hi> and that the <hi>man of wiſdome</hi> ſhall ſee <hi>Gods Name upon it.</hi> There is a great meaſure of ſpiritual Art and Wiſdome required, to inable a man to hear this voice, and to underſtand the language of it.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſafeſt and beſt way for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in this caſe, is to beleeve that all his afflictions are both for <hi>tryal</hi> and <hi>inſtruction,</hi> and alſo for <hi>ſin:</hi> Indeed when hee ſeeth another man, who is very godly, grievouſly diſeaſed, hee may charitably beleeve, that this is for his <hi>tryal,</hi> and not for his <hi>ſin,</hi> but when it is his own caſe, then (as D. <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith moſt excellently) <hi>aequiſſimum, tutiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, &amp; Dea gratiſſimum eſt, ut in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionibus omnibus peccata noſtra intuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, quae illas vel directè procurarunt, vel ſaltem promeruerunt.

                  <hi>fons &amp; fundamentum,</hi> Rom. 5. 12.<hi>—It is most equal, moſt ſafe, and moſt acceptable to God, to have an eye upon our ſins, which have either directly procured them, or at lest deſerved them.</hi> For though <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are not alwaies ſent directly and eſpecially for ſin, yet ſin is the original and foundation of all afflictions.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Sometimes wee may <hi>read our ſin</hi> in our <hi>puniſhment. Adonibezek,</hi> though a Heathen King, did this, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Threeſcore and ten Kings, having their Thumbs, and their great Toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, ſo God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited mee.</hi> I read of holy <hi>Ephrem,</hi> that hee was converted by the <hi>ſutableneſſe</hi> of his <hi>affliction,</hi> unto the ſin hee had committed, for hee ſaw clearly that his miſery came not by chance, but from God immediately, and for ſin.

of the Patient by obſerving the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians bill, ſo hee may gueſſe at his ſin by conſidering his puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Conſider what <hi>that ſin</hi> is for which thy <hi>conſcience</hi> doth moſt of all accuſe thee. Conſcience is Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, his <hi>boſome Preacher.</hi> And when wee ſleight the <hi>voyce</hi> of conſcience, God ſeconds it with the <hi>voyce</hi> of his <hi>rod,</hi> which ſpeaks the very ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that <hi>conſcience</hi> doth.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Conſider what is <hi>the ſin</hi> of thy <hi>Complexion,</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> what is thy <hi>Dilectum delictum,</hi> thy <hi>peccatum in delitiis,</hi> thy beloved ſin, what is that ſin to which thou art moſt of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and if that ſin prevail over thee, and thou canſt not ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18. 23. I have <hi>kept my ſelf from mine iniquity.</hi> It is very probable that for the ſubduing of that ſin, thou art corrected of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If ever thou haſt been at the <hi>gates of death,</hi> deſpairing of life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what <hi>that ſin</hi> was, which did then
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170160:46"/>
moſt of all trouble and perplexe thy conſcience; or if ever thou haſt been in a <hi>dream,</hi> ſuppoſing thy ſelf to bee dying, and breathing out thy laſt; what was that ſin which did then moſt of all affright thee. It is very likely that God by afflicting thee, intends to get that ſin more conquered and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Conſider what thoſe ſins are for which thy <hi>godly Miniſter</hi> (under whoſe care thou liveſt) doth reprove thee, and of which thy <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real friends</hi> do accuſe thee; for, if thou haſt ſleighted the <hi>voice</hi> of thy faithful Miniſter, and friends; ſurely <hi>God</hi> out of his love to thee, followeth their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with the <hi>voice</hi> of his Rod, that thereby hee may open thine ear to diſcipline, and command thee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thoſe iniquities.</p>
               <p>But if thou canſt not finde out that <hi>particular ſin,</hi> for which God afflicts thee, labour to repent of every ſin, and then thou wilt bee ſure to repent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170160:47"/>
of that ſin. If thou canſt not finde out the <hi>Bee</hi> that ſtings thee, pull down the <hi>whole hive,</hi> or the <hi>thorn</hi> that <hi>pricks</hi> thee, pull down the <hi>whole hedge.</hi> Do that out of wiſdome, which <hi>Herod</hi> did out of malice, who becauſe hee could not finde out the <hi>Babe Jeſus, killed all the children in Bethlehem from two years old, and under, that ſo hee might bee ſure to kill Jeſus.</hi> Let us ſeek the utter ruine and death of all our ſins, and then wee ſhall bee ſure to deſtroy that ſin for which God afflicts us, and when the cauſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the diſeaſe will forth-with bee cured, and the Almighty pacified, and reconciled unto us.</p>
               <p>2 Let us <hi>labour that the good wee reap by our afflictions, may abide upon us after</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The good wee get by our Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions muſt remain with us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</note> 
                  <hi>our recovery from them.</hi> There are very many who while they are under the Rod, ſeem to bee very penitent, and do purpoſe and promiſe to amend their lives, but as ſoon as the Rod is removed, they return like the Dog
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170160:47"/>
to the vomit, &amp;c. Such was <hi>Pharoah,</hi> whilſt hee was plagued he confeſſed his ſin, and prayed for pardon, but as ſoon as ever the judgement was gone, hee hardened his heart. Such were the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.34, 35, 36, 37. <hi>They were not ſtedfaſt, they turned back.</hi> Juſt like a truantly School-boy, who while his Maſter is whipping him, will promiſe any thing, but when it is done, forgets preſently to do what hee promiſed: Or like unto <hi>water,</hi> which while it is upon the fire is <hi>very hot,</hi> but as ſoon as ever it is taken off the fire, preſently groweth cold. I knew a <hi>man</hi> who in the time of his <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> was ſo <hi>terrified</hi> in his conſcience for his ſins, that hee made the very bed to ſhake, upon which hee lay, and cried out all night long, <hi>I am damned, I am damned,</hi> and made many and great Proteſtations of amendment of life, if God would bee pleaſed to recover him. In a little while hee did recover, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, was as bad, and as wicked as ever before.</p>

And therefore let us labour that the good wee get by our afflictions, may not <hi>vaniſh away</hi> with our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but may <hi>abide</hi> on us after wee are recovered, that wee may bee able to ſay with <hi>David, It is good for mee that I was afflicted,</hi> not onely that I <hi>am,</hi> but that I <hi>was. David</hi> praiſeth God in health, for the good hee had got in ſickneſs, and which ſtill <hi>abode</hi> with him. Let us ſay with the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.13, 14. <hi>I will go into thy houſe with burnt offerings, I will pay thee my vows which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath ſpoken, when I was in trouble.</hi> Let us pray unto God that his afflictions may not onely <hi>skin</hi> over our <hi>ſpiritual diſeaſes,</hi> and <hi>coup</hi> up our ſins; but <hi>mortifie</hi> them, and ſo <hi>change</hi> our natures, that wee may never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to folly.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this point with a famous ſaying of <hi>Plinius Secundus,</hi> worthy to bee written in letters of gold. A friend writes to him, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170160:49"/>
intreats him to give him advice how to frame his life, ſo as hee might live as becomes a good man. Hee returns him this anſwer: I will not preſcribe many rules, there is this one onely which I commend to thee above all other. <hi>Ut tales eſſe perſeveremus ſani, quales nos futuros profitemur infirmi.</hi> Let us <hi>labour to continue and perſevere to bee ſuch, when wee are well; as wee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and promiſe to our ſelves to bee, when wee are ſick.</hi> There is hardly any man ſo wicked, but hee will in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs make many and great promiſes of a new life, and of univerſal reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if God would reſtore him. Now then if wee not onely <hi>bee ſuch,</hi> but <hi>continue</hi> to bee ſuch when reſtored, as wee <hi>promiſe</hi> to be when ſick, then wee ſhall bee <hi>excellent Schollars,</hi> in the School of Affliction, and God will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as I have already ſaid) deliver us out of <hi>affliction,</hi> or ſend us to heaven by <hi>affliction.</hi> So much for the firſt Truth ſuppoſed.</p>

2 Becauſe they are not only <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,</hi> but <hi>regenerated;</hi> And as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren new born, by the <hi>inſtinct of nature,</hi> have a natural appetite to milk for conſervation of their life; ſo the new born Saint, by the <hi>inſtinct of grace,</hi> hath a ſpiritual appetite to the Word of God, according to that of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby:</hi> The Word of God is the Saints food, and as it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a child unborn to deſire food, ſo for a man unregenerated to hunger after, and take true pleaſure in the Word; and as it is impoſſible for a new born child, not to delight in Milk, ſo it is as impoſſible for a regenerate Chriſtian, not to delight in the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Becauſe a true Saint hath the Law of God <hi>written in his heart,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that precious promiſe of the Covenant of grace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and</hi>

                  <hi>write it in their hearts.</hi> A Saints heart is the counterpane to Gods Law.

And by vertue of the in-dwelling of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170160:53"/>
the Spirit, they are ſweetly and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully drawn to make the Law of God their chiefeſt delight.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Becauſe it is <hi>Gods inditement and invention.</hi> This reaſon is brought in the Text, <hi>Unleſs thy Law, &amp;c.</hi> It is the Law of that <hi>God</hi> in whom they delight. It tranſcribes the <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> of God. A true Saint ſeeth the <hi>Name, Authority, Power, Wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God in every letter of it, and therefore cannot but take pleaſure in it. It is an Epiſtle ſent down to him from the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. It is one of the greateſt <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens</hi> that ever <hi>God</hi> gave to his Church. There are two great gifts that <hi>God</hi> hath given to his people. The <hi>Word Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Word of Chriſt.</hi> Both are unſpeakably great.

               <p n="6">6 A true Saint cannot but delight in the word of God, becauſe it is his <hi>Inheritance,</hi> verſ. 111. <hi>Thy teſtimonies</hi>

                  <hi>have I taken as an heritage for ever, for they are the rejoycing of my heart.</hi> Therefore they were the rejoycing of his heart, becauſe they were his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Inheritance.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Becauſe hee findes a <hi>ſweetneſs in it.</hi> Delight is nothing elſe but a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſoul, ariſing from the ſweetneſs of the object that we enjoy.

                  <hi>teſtimonies, and I love them exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> A true Saint can ſay with <hi>David, Pſal,</hi> 119.97. <hi>Oh how do I love thy Law!</hi> and verſ. 127. <hi>I love they Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments above gold, yea above fine gold;</hi> and verſ. 72. <hi>The Law of thy mouth is better to mee than thouſands of gold and ſilver.</hi> Now becauſe the Saints of God are ſo inamoured with the Law of God, therefore it is that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but delight in it, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.47. <hi>I will delight my ſelf in thy Commandements, which I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Hee that loves the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as all Saints do) cannot but delight in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> This ſhews that there are but few <hi>true Saints</hi> amongſt us. There are many <hi>bastard Saints,</hi> and <hi>nominal Saints,</hi> but few true and real Saints. Wee live in an age, wherein there were never <hi>more</hi> Saints, and never <hi>fewer,</hi> never more by <hi>outward Profeſsion,</hi> and never fewer by a <hi>holy Converſation.</hi> It is the property of a true Saint to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170160:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make the word of God his darling and delights.</p>
               <p>But where ſhall wee finde ſuch Saints? It is eaſie to finde out men that can ſay, <hi>Eating and drinking is my delight, carding and dicing is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, reading of vain and trifling books is my delight; to ſatisfie the luſts of the fleſh is my delight.</hi> But where is the man that can truly ſay as <hi>David</hi> doth? <hi>The Law of God is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and the joy and rejoycing of my heart for ever. Auſtin</hi> profeſſeth of himſelf, that <hi>before his converſion,</hi> hee took no pleaſure in the word of God. His proud heart (as hee ſaith) would not ſtoop to the humble expreſſions of it. <hi>After his converſion,</hi> hee was raviſhed with the beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Scriptures, but before his converſion, hee ſaw no excellency in them. Policarp (though a great Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, yet a notorious Atheiſt) profeſſeth moſt blaſphemouſly, that hee never loſt more time than in reading the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170160:55"/>
Scripture. And it is reported of <hi>Plato,</hi> that when hee had read the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> hee ſaid, <hi>Hic vir multa dicit, ſed nihil probat.</hi> This man ſaith many things, but proveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Where ſhall wee finde the man that puts a due eſtimation upon the word of God? That prizeth it <hi>above gold, yea above much fine gold? That rejoyeeth in thy word as much as in all riches,</hi> verſ. 14. That can appeal to God, and ſay as <hi>David,</hi> verſ. 159. <hi>Conſider, Oh Lord, how I love thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts?</hi> and verſe 97. <hi>Oh how do I love thy Law?</hi> There are ſome men that can delight in any thing but in God, and his Word, and his Ordinances; They can delight in the creatures of God, but cannot delight in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God. They can delight in the gifts of God, in riches, and health, and honours: But they cannot delight in the God of theſe gifts. They can delight in books of Philoſophy, and humanity, but they cannot delight in the word of God.</p>

               <p>It is certain that they are not <hi>born anew,</hi> for if they were new born babes, they would deſire the ſincere milk of the word.</p>
               <p>It is certain that the <hi>Law of God</hi> is not yet <hi>written in their hearts,</hi> and that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth not dwell in them.

And as thou wilt meditate on it, ſo thou wilt bee often, and unweariſome in reading and peruſing of it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing about it. A man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in hunting, is never weary of talking of hunting, and he that delights in the world, of ſpeaking about the world; and if you did delight in Gods word, you would be very frequent, and indefatigable in diſcourſing of it.</p>

2 If you did delight in the <hi>Word of God,</hi> you would delight in the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Ambaſſadors</hi> of the Word lawfully commiſſionated by Chriſt: For the great work of the Miniſtry is to expound and apply the Word; and therefore if you diſ-reſpect the godly learned lawful Miniſtry of the Word, you take no delight in the Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They that delight in the Word, will bee <hi>at any coſt</hi> to bring the Word to their congregations, they will part with thouſands of gold and ſilver, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than with the Word; <hi>Hee that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems the VVord above thouſands, will bee willing to part with hundreds for the Words ſake.</hi> Hee will account a famine of the Word more bitter than a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of bread; by how much the <hi>ſoul</hi> is better than the <hi>body,</hi> by ſo much will hee bee more troubled for a <hi>ſoul-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> than a <hi>bodily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Hee that delights truely in the Law, will <hi>ſincerely</hi> labour to <hi>obey it,</hi> and bee much <hi>grieved</hi> when it is diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <p>And therefore you that delight in ſin, you cannot bee ſaid to delight in the Word; and you that are not pained and grieved when others ſin, you are

               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:170160:59"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a wide and vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the joy and delight which a true Saint takes in Gods Word, and that which may bee found in an hypocrite.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The delight of a godly man, is <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and ſeaſonable.</hi> It is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of conviction and humiliation; For though <hi>Joy</hi> bee the great work of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet it is not the firſt work. Firſt, The <hi>Spirit</hi> by the Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth and humbleth, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth; therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Bleſsed are thoſe that mourn, for they ſhall bee comforted;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 5. <hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy.</hi> But the joy of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is <hi>unſeaſonable and diſorderly.</hi> It is his firſt work. It is ſaid of the ſtony ground, that when <hi>they heard the Word, they received it immediately with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Mark. 4. 16. It is not ſaid, they received it <hi>firſt</hi> with ſorrow, and <hi>then</hi> with gladneſſe. Here is mention of joy without any antecedent humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170160:60"/>
Nay, the Text ſaith expreſly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>it lacked moiſture,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it withered away. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Profeſſors in our daies that <hi>skip</hi> from ſin, to joy at firſt, that all in an inſtant are in the <hi>higheſt form</hi> of ſin, and in the <hi>higheſt form</hi> of comfort, that skip out of the <hi>lap</hi> of the Devil, into the <hi>lap</hi> of joy<hi>:</hi> Theſe are as the ſtony ground. Theſe are <hi>wanton Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:</hi> They <hi>ſow</hi> before they <hi>plough;</hi> they know not the bitterneſſe of ſin, and therefore in time of temptation fall away.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The delight that a godly man takes in the Word, is a well-rooted delight. It is rooted in an <hi>humble, good,</hi> and <hi>honest heart,</hi> as is ſaid of the good ground, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 15. But the delight of an hypocrite is <hi>ſhallow and ſuperficial;</hi> as his graces are ſleight and formal, ſo are his delights. Therefore it is ſaid of the ſeed that fell upon the ſtony ground, that it had <hi>no root, Luk.</hi> 8. 13. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>it wanted depth of</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:170160:60"/>
                  <hi>earth,</hi> and therefore when the Sun aroſe, it was ſcorched. The Apoſtle hints this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4.—and have <hi>taſted</hi> the good Word of God. The delight of a wicked man in the Word, is but a <hi>taſting</hi> and <hi>ſipping,</hi> no <hi>ſoaking;</hi> a float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloft in the river of Chriſts blood, no diving down to the bottom. A man may taſte a thing, and not like it, taſte, and <hi>like it,</hi> and yet not come up to the price of it, as the <hi>young man,</hi> Matth. 19. 22. Hee was very deſirous to injoy eternal life, but hee would not part with his poſſeſſions for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it. A Cook taſteth of the meat hee dreſſeth, but they only that are invited eate of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taſting</hi> doth not imply <hi>habitual grace.</hi> A man may taſte that which hee never digeſteth, nor concocteth. The Iſraelites taſted of the firſt fruits of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet did not enter into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Such is the joy of the hypocrite. It is <hi>outward and ſuperficial:</hi> But the delight of a true
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170160:61"/>
Saint is <hi>inward, ſolid, and ſubſtantial. Jeremy</hi> ſaith, that the Word of God was the <hi>joy and rejoycing of his heart,</hi> and that hee did eat it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 16. hee did not only taſte it, but eate it. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward man;</hi> His delights had depth of earth, they were well digeſted, and concocted.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is <hi>ſuperlative and overtopping.</hi> A godly man delighteth more in God, and his Word, than in any worldly thing whatſoever. <hi>Lord lift thou up</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 4. 6, 7.) <hi>The light of thy countenance upon us, thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</hi> So alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43. 4.<hi>—unto God my exceeding Joy,</hi> Pſa. 137.6. <hi>If I prefer not Jeruſalem above my chief Joy.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.72.127. The delight of a Saint in Gods Word overtoppeth all his creature delights, and injoyments, and for the joy he findes in it, <hi>he will fell all hee hath to purchaſe it,</hi> Matth. 13. 44.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170160:61"/>
But the joy of a wicked man is of an <hi>inferior nature,</hi> hee rejoyceth more in <hi>Corn, Wine,</hi> and <hi>Oil, &amp;c.</hi> And when it comes into competition, hee will leave his <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi> rather than loſe his <hi>creature and carnal pleaſures.</hi> Thus <hi>Herod</hi> rejoyced in the word that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> preached, but hee rejoyced more in his <hi>Herodias;</hi> and when it came to the tryal, hee choſe to behead <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> rather than to part with <hi>Herod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>1 The ſtony ground, when perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution aroſe, parted with all its joy and faith, rather than it would loſe its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or life. As a godly man <hi>rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in worldly things, as though hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced not,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 30. So a wicked man <hi>rejoyceth in ſpiritual things, as though hee rejoyced not.</hi> In the old Law thoſe <hi>Fouls</hi> that did both <hi>flye</hi> and <hi>ſwimme,</hi> were unclean: A wicked man would many times <hi>flye aloft</hi> in <hi>ſpiritual delights,</hi> but hee would alſo <hi>bathe</hi> himſelf, and <hi>ſwimme</hi> in carnal pleaſures,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170160:62"/>
and his heart is more affected with worldly advancement, and bodily-recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, than with heavenly, and this is a ſign that he is an <hi>unclean Chriſtian,</hi> and that his delights in God, and his Word are not right, becauſe they are not <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertopping</hi> and <hi>ſuperlative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 It is <hi>powerful and ſoul-ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> full of life, vigour, and activity; it will inable the ſoul to do and ſuffer any thing for God, it turns a <hi>priſon</hi> into a <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> it makes <hi>Martyrdome</hi> to bee as a <hi>bed of Roſes,</hi> it is <hi>armour of proof</hi> to ſteel us, and make us fit to indure Afflictions, both for God, and from God; therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith in the Text. <hi>Unleſs thy Law had been my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, I ſhould then have periſhed in mine Affliction.</hi> His delight in the Law ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him from ſinking. It is like <hi>Oil</hi> to the <hi>VVheels,</hi> like <hi>Sails</hi> to the <hi>Ship,</hi> and <hi>wings</hi> to the <hi>bird;</hi> but the delight that a wicked man hath in the Word is a <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erleſs, dead, fruitleſs,</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthleſs</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. It is as a <hi>paper helmet,</hi> and a

                  <hi>painted fire,</hi> it will not ſupport him in the hour of adverſity<hi>:</hi> The perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the ſtony ground, fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, notwithſtanding their joy, aſſoon as ever perſecution aroſe for the Goſpel. But the joy of a true Saint is <hi>ſoul-ſupporting,</hi> and <hi>ſoul-upholding. The joy in the Lord is their ſtrength,</hi> Ne. 8.10.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The delight that a godly man hath in the Word, is <hi>ſin-excluding.</hi> It cannot conſiſt with a delight in any ſin; therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 11. <hi>Thy VVord have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> Sin is as a <hi>woodden window,</hi> to ſhut out the true joyes of the Spirit. But now a wicked man, though hee may delight in the <hi>VVord,</hi> yet hee alſo delights in <hi>ſinning againſt the VVord.</hi> Although <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly, yet hee kept his <hi>Herodias,</hi> And though the Iſraelites delighted to <hi>know Gods waies,</hi> yet they did not <hi>delight</hi> to <hi>walk in his waies.</hi> They were <hi>as a Nation</hi> that did righteouſneſs, hee doth not ſay,

they were ſuch, but <hi>quaſigens, &amp;c. as a Nation</hi> that did righteouſneſs. And though they <hi>delighted to approach to God,</hi> yet they did not delight to <hi>obey</hi> that God, before whom they approached; they took pleaſure in ſinning againſt God, as well as in ſerving of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. It was not a <hi>ſin-excluding</hi> joy, and therefore it was falſe and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</p>
               <p n="6">6 It is <hi>grace-increaſing.</hi> The more a Saint delights in the <hi>VVord of God,</hi> the more careful hee will bee to obey the <hi>VVill of God,</hi> and to grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the grace of God; therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 167. <hi>My ſoul hath kept thy teſtimonies, for I love them exceedingly.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 8. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy VVill, O my God, yea thy Law is within my heart;</hi> becauſe the Law was written in his heart, therefore hee delighted to do it.

55, 56. <hi>I have remembred thy Name, O Lord, and have kept thy Law, this I had, becauſe I have kept thy Precepts.</hi> What had <hi>David</hi> for keeping Gods precepts? Hee had power to keep his Law, that is, to grow and increaſe in keeping of it. As the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. ſpeaks of the knowledge of God. <hi>Then ſhall wee know, if wee follow on to know the Lord,</hi> that is, if we induſtriouſly labour to know God, wee ſhall have this reward, to bee made able to know him more. So may I ſay of the grace of God. <hi>Hee that delights to keep Gods Law, ſhall have this reward, to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abbed to keep it more perfectly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A true delight in Gods Word is <hi>Grace increaſing.</hi> Grace is the <hi>Mother</hi> of all true joy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. and joy is as the <hi>Daughter;</hi> and the Mother and Daughter live and dye together.

                  <hi>Quantum creſcis in gratiâ, tantum dilatâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris in fiduciâ.</hi> But now a wicked man, though hee may have a <hi>kinde</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Gods word, yet it is not a delight of the <hi>right kinde.</hi> It doth not argue that hee hath true grace in him.</p>
               <p>An hypocrite is <hi>all joy,</hi> and <hi>no grace;</hi> a <hi>Giant</hi> in joy, and not ſo much as a <hi>dwarf</hi> in grace, like a <hi>green bough</hi> tyed to a <hi>dead tree.</hi> Hee is in the <hi>higheſt form</hi> of joy, and not ſo much as in the <hi>loweſt form</hi> of grace.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The delight that a godly man hath in the word, is not onely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> but a <hi>ſpiritual delight,</hi> grounded upon ſpiritual aimes and reaſons.

Auſtin</hi> before his converſion, rejoyced much to hear <hi>Ambroſe</hi> preach, but it was becauſe of his eloquence (as hee ſaith) not upon a ſpiritual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170160:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
A wicked man may follow a <hi>Preacher,</hi> and delight in his preaching, becauſe of his elegant words, and Rhetorical expreſſions, becauſe <hi>hee is unto him as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voyce, &amp;c.</hi> as it is <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.32. Or, <hi>out of novelty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe newly come (as the Iſraelites de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in Manna at firſt, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards loathed it) or becauſe hee <hi>loves his perſon;</hi> or out of a deſire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a form of knowledge in heavenly things. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> delighted to do many ſpiritual things out of <hi>vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory. John</hi> delighted to do the will of God, but it was for his own ends. <hi>Pauci quaerunt Jeſum, propter Jeſum. Stella</hi> is of opinion, that the Devil perſwaded <hi>Herod, to hear John Baptiſt gladly, and to reverence him, and to do many things,</hi> that ſo hee might hold him the faſter in his poſſeſſion. The Devil had him ſure by one ſin, and therefore hee <hi>provoked</hi> him to do <hi>ſome good things,</hi> that ſo hee might rock
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170160:65"/>
him aſleep in preſumption, and by his good things hee might quiet his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and put a fair gloſs upon his inceſtuous practices. A man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in ſpiritual things upon ſinful grounds and reaſons. But now a true <hi>Saint delights</hi> in the <hi>word</hi> upon a <hi>ſpiritual account,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>Gods word,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> would have him <hi>delight in it,</hi> becauſe it is his <hi>guide to glory,</hi> the way by which he is ſanctified. It is both <hi>concha &amp; canalis.</hi> A <hi>Ciſtern</hi> to contain the glorious myſteries of ſalvation, and a <hi>Conduit</hi> to conveigh God and grace into his ſoul.</p>
               <p>In a word, hee delights in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>holy and pure,</hi> hee can ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.140. <hi>Thy word is very pure, therefore thy ſervant loveth it.</hi> This no wicked man can truly ſay.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The delight that a godly man takes in the word, is without <hi>any reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or diſtinction.</hi> Hee delights in the <hi>whole word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in the <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>threatning</hi> word, as well as in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170160:65"/>
the <hi>promiſing</hi> word; hee beholds God, and his <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> in every verſe, and therefore hee can ſay with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 39.8. <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord.</hi> He hath the <hi>whole Law</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart, and rejoyceth in every <hi>tittle of it.</hi> But a wicked man hath his <hi>reſervations</hi> and <hi>diſtinctions,</hi> hee may delight in the <hi>promiſing</hi> word, but hee undervalues the <hi>commanding</hi> word, and turneth a deaf ear to the <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> word. It is ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> That <hi>they rejoyced in the light of John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> but it is not ſaid, They <hi>rejoyced in his heat:</hi> Hee was a <hi>burning,</hi> and a <hi>ſhining light,</hi> they rejoyced in his <hi>ſhining,</hi> but not in his <hi>burning.</hi> It is hardly poſſible for a wicked man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining wicked, to rejoyce in the <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing zeal, holineſs,</hi> and <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> of a <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> But a godly man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth both in the <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> of the word.</p>

16. 22. Your joy <hi>no man taketh from you.</hi> It is as a <hi>fixed ſtar.</hi> But the delight of a wicked man in the word, is as the <hi>crackling of thorns</hi> upon the fire, and as the Corn that grew on the ſtony ground, which quickly ſprung up, and as quickly withered, <hi>Job.</hi> 27.8.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170160:69"/>
of the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is the <hi>Magazin</hi> and <hi>ſtorehouſe</hi> of all comfort and conſolation. There is no condition (but one) that a man can bee in, but hee may finde ſoul ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting comfort for it our of the Word. Indeed if thou reſolveſt to go on in ſin, the Word cannot comfort thee; it threatneth hell and damnation to all ſuch. If the <hi>God of Heaven</hi> can make ſuch miſerable, they ſhall bee miſerable: But excepting this one, there is no condition ſo miſerable, but a man may fetch a cordial out of the Word, to ſupport him under it. Art thou as <hi>empty</hi> of riches, and as <hi>full</hi> of diſeaſes, as <hi>Job</hi> under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> under the New Teſtament? are the (ſins with which thou art willing to part) many and great? Is thy conſcience exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly wounded and diſquieted? doth the Devil roar upon thee with hideous temptations? let thy condition bee never ſo ſad, the Word of God is able
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170160:70"/>
to afford thee comfort under it. For it is the <hi>Word</hi> of that <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>God of all conſolation.</hi> There is no kinde of true comfort, but here it is to bee had, here are cordials of all ſorts. Comforts under <hi>bodily troubles,</hi> and comforts under <hi>ſoul-troubles.</hi> There is no <hi>Monarch</hi> can furniſh his table with ſuch variety of delicates, as <hi>God</hi> hath furniſhed his <hi>Word</hi> with variety of comforts.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Word of God is not only the <hi>Magazin</hi> of all true comfort, but the <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence it is derived. All the comfort that you receive by reading of good books, is fetcht out of this book. All the refreſhings that the <hi>Ambaſsadors</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to you, are borrowed from this <hi>Fountain.</hi> As the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the woman (that cryed out, ſaying, <hi>Help my Lord O King) If the</hi>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170160:70"/>
cries out for comfort: How can wee comfort you, if the Word of God doth not comfort you? All our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts muſt bee fetcht from thence.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It will comfort us <hi>at ſuch a time,</hi> when no outward thing can comfort us. And that is, when wee are under <hi>ſoul-agonies,</hi> and when our ſoul ſits upon our lips, ready to depart, when wee are ſailing into the <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> then, even then, the promiſes of the Word will comfort us<hi>:</hi> When gold and ſilver, Father and Mother, friends, and Phyſitians are miſerable comforters, then will one <hi>promiſe</hi> out of the Word fill us full of joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and glorious.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>The Comforts</hi> of the <hi>Word exceed</hi> all other <hi>comforts,</hi> for they are <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>purifying, ſure,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfying;</hi> they are <hi>ſoul-ſupporting, ſoul-comforting,</hi> and <hi>ſoul-raviſhing;</hi> they are <hi>durable</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting.</hi> The comforts of the world are not worthy to bee named that day, in which wee ſpeak of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170160:71"/>
comforts of the Word. They are not <hi>conſolationes,</hi> but <hi>conſolatiunculae.</hi> At beſt they are but <hi>bodily, unſatisfying,</hi> and <hi>tranſitory.</hi> Many times they are ſinful, and ſoul-damning.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The Word of God is not only a <hi>Magazin,</hi> and a <hi>Fountain</hi> of comfort, but alſo a <hi>touch-ſtone,</hi> by which wee muſt trie all our comforts, whether they bee true and real, or no. All joyes, hopes, and aſſurances, muſt be tried by the Word, and if not rightly grounded thereupon, are falſe, and ſoul-deluſions.</p>
               <p n="6">6 It is as an <hi>Apothecaries ſhop,</hi> or a <hi>Phyſitians diſpenſatory,</hi> out of which wee may fetch all manner of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi> to cure all the diſeaſes of our <hi>ſouls.</hi> Art thou ſpiritually lame, blinde, or dumb? &amp;c. The Word will open blinde eyes, make the dumb to ſpeak, and the lame to walk. If dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, the Word, when it is the ſword of the ſpirit, will quicken thee. It is as a corraſive to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170160:71"/>
eat ſin out of thy heart; therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have hid thy Word in mine heart, that I might not ſin against thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 It is a <hi>ſpiritual Armory;</hi> out of which wee may fetch all manner of weapons, to conquer the Devil, and his temptations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. It is that <hi>little brook,</hi> out of which every <hi>David</hi> may fetch <hi>five ſmooth ſtones</hi> to deſtroy the Devil. Theſe five ſmooth ſtones, are five texts of Scripture, three of theſe Chriſt took out of the brook of the Word, by which hee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Devil, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 4. 7, 10.</p>
               <p n="8">8 It is the <hi>Sun of the Chriſtian world.</hi> As the <hi>Sun</hi> is the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>natural world,</hi> and without it, the world is but a Chaos, and a dungeon full of darkneſs. So is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>ſpiritual world,</hi> without which a Chriſtian is under an eternal night. Therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path,</hi> Pſal. 119. 105.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170160:72"/>
What would all the world avail, if no Sun to illighten it, and what comfort would all the wealth of it afford us, if, no word to inſtruct, and counſel us? For this is the Chriſtians compaſs to ſail to Heaven by, his ſtaffe to walk withal to Heaven, his ſpiritual bladders to keep his ſoul from drowning. The Cork, to keep up the net of his ſoul from ſinking. Afflictions are like the <hi>lead</hi> of the net, which weigheth it down, but the <hi>Word</hi> is as the <hi>Cork,</hi> which keeps it up, that it ſinks not. So ſaith <hi>David</hi> in the Text, <hi>Unleſs thy Law had been my delights, &amp;c.</hi>

you to make the Word your <hi>delights,</hi> ſhall bee this in the Text.

It will bee food, to ſtrengthen your weak Faith; phyſick to cure the remainders of corruptions, it will bee a cordial to revive your drooping ſpirits, and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls.

               <p>Queſt. But now the great queſtion is, <hi>How a child of God ought to manage and make uſe of the word of God, ſo as to make it a conduit of</hi> ſupport <hi>and</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <hi>in the day of his greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To bee able to do this, there is a great deal of ſpiritual wiſdome and underſtanding required. For the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170160:74"/>
word to many people is like <hi>Sauls</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to <hi>David,</hi> which was ſo cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to him, that hee could not wear it.</p>
               <p>There are many know not how to uſe the Word, ſo as to bee comforted by it. As the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> told Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>The well is deep, and thou haſt nothing to draw with.</hi> So may I ſay; The <hi>word of God</hi> is a <hi>deep well,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 4.</note> it is a <hi>well</hi> of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> but it is <hi>deep,</hi> and the <hi>deeper,</hi> the <hi>ſweeter,</hi> but moſt people want <hi>buckets</hi> to draw with; they want a <hi>ſpiritual Art</hi> to fetch out of theſe wells of ſalvation, divine ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and conſolation; and therefore to help you in this great work you muſt know,</p>
               <p>That the word of God may bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three parts; Into <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The word of God divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and promiſing Word.</note> 
                  <hi>Threatnings,</hi> and <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> And though a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> muſt not neglect the <hi>commanding,</hi> and <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning word,</hi> yet if ever hee would make the <hi>word</hi> a <hi>channel</hi> of <hi>divine comfort,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:170160:75"/>
hee muſt ſtudy the <hi>promiſing word,</hi> for the promiſes are a Chriſtians <hi>magna charta</hi> for Heaven. All comfort muſt bee built upon a Scripture promiſe, elſe it is preſumption, not true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The promiſes are <hi>pabulum fidei, &amp; anima fidei,</hi> the food of faith, and the ſoul of faith. As faith is the <hi>life</hi> of a Chriſtian, ſo the <hi>promiſes</hi> are the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Faith: Faith</hi> is a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> if it hath no promiſe to quicken it; As the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are of no uſe without <hi>Faith</hi> to apply them, ſo <hi>Faith</hi> is of no uſe without a <hi>promiſe</hi> to lay hold on. And the great reaſon why the people of God walk uncomfortably in their afflictions, is, becauſe they do not <hi>chew</hi> the <hi>promiſes;</hi> they are <hi>rare cordials,</hi> but as a man cannot taſte the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of a <hi>cordial,</hi> unleſs hee <hi>chew</hi> it, no more can wee receive any <hi>ſpiritual refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from the <hi>promiſes,</hi> unleſs wee <hi>meditate</hi> on them. The promiſes are as a <hi>Mine</hi> full of <hi>rich treaſure,</hi> but as Mines, unleſſe wee digge deep into
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170160:75"/>
them, wee can never get the gold and ſilver hid in them: no more can wee injoy the <hi>ſoul-raviſhing</hi> comfort, of the <hi>promiſes,</hi> unleſſe wee <hi>digge</hi> into them by a <hi>ſerious conſideration</hi> of them. They are as a <hi>garden</hi> full of <hi>rare flowers,</hi> able to ſweeten any condition. But becauſe wee do not <hi>walk</hi> in this <hi>garden,</hi> and pick out theſe flowers; hence it is that wee live ſo <hi>diſconſolately</hi> and dejectedly under our afflictions. There are many <hi>rare ſtories</hi> declaring the comfort that ſome of Gods Saints have received from the promiſes in the day of their diſtreſs. Mr. <hi>Bilney that bleſſed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> was much wounded in conſcience, by reaſon of the great ſin hee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in ſubſcribing to the Popiſh errors, but hee was much comforted by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe words, 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 1. 15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of which I am the chief. Beza</hi> was ſupported under his troubles, by the words of Chriſt,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170160:76"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> 10.27, 28, 29. Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> tells us of one, that was upheld under great affliction, and comforted from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 3. Of another, from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. I knew a young maid that went triumphantly to Heaven, by the refreſhing ſhee found in that well known Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. and many that have been wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cheared by reading the eight <hi>chapter</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by that Text, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>VVee know that wee have paſſed from death unto life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee love the Brethren.</hi> The truth is, there is no promiſe, but if God bee pleaſed to <hi>illighten it,</hi> and ſhew us our intereſt in it, will afford a harveſt of joy. It is with <hi>promiſes,</hi> as it is with <hi>Sermons:</hi> That <hi>Sermon</hi> which once heard, did not at all work upon us, the ſame Sermon heard at another time may exceedingly affect us. And the ſame Text of Scripture, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth not at all comfort us, may at another time convey much comfort to us. Two men troubled in conſcience,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170160:76"/>
may both of them read the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hear the ſame Sermon, and one of them may have his troubled minde pacified, and the other continue troubled, and the reaſon is, becauſe the Spirit of God makes the Word <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to one,</hi> and <hi>not to the other.</hi> How often hath a diſtreſſed Saint, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 27, 28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 15, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. and found no comfort in reading of them; But if the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> did <hi>come in,</hi> and open his eyes to behold the <hi>rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> wrapt up in theſe promiſes, and <hi>his intereſt</hi> in them, they would fill him with comfort above expreſſion. And therefore if ever you would make the Word of God, Gods inſtrument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh, ſupport and comfort to you in the time of <hi>ſoul-ſinking afflictions,</hi> you muſt ſtudy the promiſes, and pray unto God that his Spirit may <hi>irradiate</hi> them, and ſhew you the fulneſſe of them, and your intereſt in them.</p>

others, (like the Sun, in compariſon of the Moon) yet every promiſe hath its beauty, and luſtre, and as ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in a dark night is very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; ſo in the dark night of affliction, every <hi>little promiſe</hi> will afford unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comfort to a troubled ſoul.</p>
               <p>To help you in making this Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, give mee leave to ſuggeſt three things.</p>

               <p n="6">6 God hath promiſed <hi>to lay no more upon us, than wee are able to bear,</hi> but either to give us leſs <hi>pain,</hi> or <hi>greater patience,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 13.

make a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> but hee muſt alſo</p>

                     <hi>Jewels</hi> in his heart, and then <hi>unlock</hi> them by <hi>meditation;</hi> firſt hee muſt make his <hi>Noſe-gay,</hi> and then ſmell of it. The Word of God (as I have ſaid) is as a <hi>Garden</hi> full of <hi>excellent Promiſes,</hi> as ſo many <hi>choice flowers.</hi> And it is our duty to <hi>walk</hi> often in this <hi>Garden,</hi> to gather up all the flowers that lye ſcattered in it, into ſeveral <hi>Noſe-gayes,</hi> to binde them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (if I may ſo ſpeak) with the <hi>threed of Faith,</hi> and then every day to ſmell of them. The <hi>Promiſes</hi> are the <hi>Saints Legacies</hi> left them by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>laſt will and Teſtament:</hi> The Saints are called, the <hi>heirs of the Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 6. 17. And if they would bee filled full of joy in the day of their diſtreſs, they muſt bee frequent in reading theſe <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:</hi> The <hi>Promiſes</hi> are (as it were)

the <hi>breaſts of God,</hi> full of the <hi>Milk of grace and comfort.</hi> And it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bee ſucking out (by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the milk of grace and comfort contained in them.

                     <hi>joy, all yee that are mourners in Sion; that yee may ſuck and bee ſatisfied with the breaſts of their conſolations, that yee may milk out, and bee delighted with the abundance of joy and comfort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them.</hi> The Promiſes are the Saints <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> (as one calls them) the Saints <hi>cordials,</hi> the Saints <hi>plank,</hi> to ſwim to Heaven upon, the Saints <hi>fiery Chariot,</hi> to carry them up to Heaven. And the great reaſon why they walk ſo <hi>uncomfortably,</hi> ſo <hi>diſconſolately,</hi> and ſo <hi>unbeleevingly</hi> in the time of their tribulation, is becauſe they do not <hi>ſmell</hi> of theſe <hi>Noſe-gayes,</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:170160:85"/>
they do not <hi>chew</hi> theſe <hi>cordials,</hi> they do not read over theſe <hi>ſpiritual Legacies,</hi> they do not by ſerious <hi>meditation</hi> and <hi>conſideration, ſuck</hi> out the comfort comprehended in them. For as <hi>fire</hi> will not warm us, unleſs wee tarry at it, and a <hi>Bee</hi> cannot ſuck out the <hi>hony</hi> that is in a <hi>flower,</hi> unleſs ſhee abide upon it; no more can any <hi>child of God</hi> receive <hi>ſupportation</hi> and <hi>conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from the Promiſes in the hour of temptation, unleſs hee ſeriouſly and ſolemnly ponder and meditate on them.</p>
                  <p>There is a double difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>preſumptuous ſinner,</hi> and a <hi>poor, humble, diſtreſſed</hi> child of God.</p>
                  <p>1 A <hi>Preſumptuous ſinner</hi> ſtudieth <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and a true child of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> nothing but the <hi>promiſing Word.</hi> Hee ſleights the <hi>commanding,</hi> and the <hi>threatning Word.</hi> The Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to keep holy the Sabbath day, not to love the world, not to luſt, but hee turns a <hi>deaf ear</hi> to it. The Word threatneth to <hi>wound the</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:170160:85"/>
                     <hi>hairy ſcalp of every one that goeth on in his wickedneſſe,</hi> but becauſe <hi>God</hi> is <hi>patient,</hi> and <hi>long ſuffering,</hi> therefore he regards it not. But as for the <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing VVord,</hi> hee <hi>ſnatcheth</hi> at it, he doth not truly <hi>lay hold on it,</hi> but <hi>ſnatcheth</hi> at it, before it belongs to him, and <hi>ſpider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> ſucks the <hi>poiſon</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> out of it, and makes of it a <hi>cradle</hi> to <hi>rock</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſleep in ſinful courſes. Becauſe God hath promiſed, <hi>that whenſoever a Sinner turns from his ſins which hee hath committed, hee ſhall ſurely live, and not dye,</hi> therefore hee delaies, and prorogues his turning from ſin.</p>
                  <p>But now a <hi>poor, diſtreſſed, humble Chriſtian,</hi> fails on the contrary part; hee <hi>pores</hi> upon the <hi>commanding and threatning Word,</hi> but never ponders the <hi>promiſing VVord.</hi> God (ſaith hee) commands mee to <hi>love him with all my heart and ſoul,</hi> to <hi>waſh my heart from iniquity,</hi> to <hi>love my enemies,</hi> to <hi>cut off my right hand, and pluck out my right eye, &amp;c.</hi> But I cannot perform
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170160:86"/>
theſe commands, therefore ſurely I ſhall never bee ſaved. God (ſaith hee) hath threatned to <hi>curſe every one that continueth not in every thing that is written in his Law, to do it,</hi> and therefore ſurely I am accurſed. But hee never ſtudies, nor ponders the promiſing Word, for if hee did, hee <note place="margin">Three ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveable things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Promiſes.</note> would quickly <hi>know three things</hi> for his everlaſting comfort.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That <hi>there is nothing required by God in his VVord as our duty, but God hath either promiſed to beſtow it upon us as his gift, or the Saints have prayed to God for it as his gift.</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to love him, but hee hath promiſed to <hi>circumciſe our hearts to love him, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 30. 6.

                     <hi>from our evil waies.</hi> The Saints of God alſo have prayed unto God for this, as the fruit of his free mercy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5. 21. There is nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> but God hath promiſed in the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> in ſome meaſure to work it in us, for hee hath promiſed to <hi>work all our works in us,</hi> and to <hi>write his Law</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 26.12</note> (not one Commandement of it only, but the whole Law) <hi>in our hearts,</hi> and to <hi>put it in our inward parts,</hi> and to <hi>cauſe</hi>

If there bee a <hi>willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that hee hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 12.</p>

3 That <hi>though hee cannot in his own perſon perform all that God commands, yet Jeſus Chriſt as his ſurety, and in his ſtead, hath fulfilled the Law for him, and that God will accept of Chriſts perfect, as a cover for his imperfect righteouſneſſe.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath <hi>redeemed him from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for him.</hi> That the threatnings of the Law are <hi>Serpents</hi> without a <hi>ſting,</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath taken away the power and force of them.</p>
                  <p>Did a <hi>broken-hearted,</hi> and <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner</hi> ponder and meditate on theſe things, they would fill him full of joy and comfort. Hee would flye from the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> to the <hi>Covenant of grace;</hi> from his own <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> unto the <hi>righteouſneſs of Chriſt;</hi> and from the <hi>commanding</hi> and <hi>threatning word,</hi> unto the <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing word:</hi> hee would ſay, Lord! Thou commandeſt mee to walk in thy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and to keep thy Laws<hi>:</hi> This I cannot do of my ſelf, but thou haſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170160:87"/>
promiſed <hi>to cauſe mee to walk in thy wayes,</hi> and to <hi>write thy Law in my</hi>

                     <hi>heart.</hi> Lord give mee power to do what thou commandeſt, and then command what thou wilt.</p>
                  <p>2 A <hi>preſumptuous ſinner</hi> is alwaies <note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> ſtudying the promiſing Word, to <hi>bolſter</hi> up himſelf in ſin, but hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtudies his <hi>ſins and iniquities, to repent for them, and from them.</hi> Hee meditates on the Promiſes to <hi>harden</hi> his heart in ſin, but not at all on his ſins to <hi>humble</hi> himſelf for them, and to turn from them.</p>
                  <p>But now on the contrary <hi>A poor diſtreſſed Chriſtian</hi> pores upon his <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and corruptions,</hi> but never mindes himſelf of the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and this makes him live ſo dejectedly, and diſconſolately. A wicked man ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his <hi>corruptions too little.</hi> A di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Chriſtian <hi>too much.</hi> If hee did ſtudy the Promiſes, as much as hee doth his corruptions, hee would not walk ſo uncomfortably.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:170160:88"/>
Wherefore if ever you would make the <hi>Word of God a conduit</hi> of <hi>comfort</hi> in the day of your diſtreſs; you muſt not only meditate on the <hi>commanding,</hi> and <hi>threatning Word,</hi> but on the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Word.</hi> The Commandements and threatnings muſt drive you to the Promiſes; you muſt not only ſtudy your <hi>corruptions</hi> to <hi>humble you,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Promiſes</hi> to <hi>comfort you.</hi> I do not ſay, you muſt <hi>not ſtudy your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,</hi> but you muſt joyn the ſtudy of the Promiſes together with them. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had minded only the <hi>deadneſſe of Sarahs womb,</hi> and of his own body, he had never beleeved, &amp;c. but hee was ſtrong in Faith, and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered not, becauſe hee <hi>conſidered not his own body now dead, when hee was about an hundred years old, nor the deadneſs of Sarahs wombe, but was fully</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 19, 20, 21</note> 
                     <hi>perſwaded, that what God had promiſed, hee was able to perform.</hi> If <hi>Sarah</hi> had conſidered only that ſhee was paſt age, ſhee would never have beleeved
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170160:88"/>
that ſhee ſhould have a childe, but ſhee eyed the Promiſe, and <hi>judged him faithful, who had promiſed,</hi> and that <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 11</note> made her beleeve. If a Saint of God <hi>looks</hi> only <hi>downwards</hi> upon the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his heart, and meditates on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his ſins and infirmities; hee will never bee comforted in the day of his diſtreſſe. But hee muſt alſo <hi>look upwards</hi> unto the Promiſes, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ponder, and fixedly ſtudy them, which will bee as <hi>ſtrong Pillars</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him, and keep him from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into deſpair, in the hour of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the</hi> Meditations <hi>which wee muſt have in reference and relation to the Promiſes in the day of our diſtreſs?</hi>

that hee is pleaſed to enter into a Promiſe and Covenant, to bee their God, and to give them Chriſt, and in Chriſt all bleſſings here, and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170160:99"/>
And there is nothing moved God to do this (but, as I have ſaid) his free grace and mercy.

If <hi>God</hi> hath written his Law in thy heart, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170160:107"/>
given thee a <hi>Goſpel-frame,</hi> inclining thee to the obedience of all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements <hi>ſincerely,</hi> though not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly;</hi> this is an <hi>infallible evidence,</hi> that thou haſt a right and portion in all the Promiſes. This is that which God ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>If you will obey my voice indeed, then yee ſhall bee a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar treaſure, &amp;c.</hi> If yee will obey my voice <hi>indeed,</hi> not only in word, and in ſhew, but in <hi>deed,</hi> and in <hi>truth.</hi> Thus <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 5, 7. <hi>If yee thoroughly amend your waies, if yee thoroughly execute judgement, &amp;c. then will I cauſe you to dwell in this place, &amp;c.</hi> If yee <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly</hi> amend, &amp;c. not only in <hi>ſome things,</hi> but in <hi>all things;</hi> not only <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi> but <hi>inwardly</hi> alſo. This Rule is expreſly delivered by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Godlineſſe hath the Promiſe of the life that now is, and that which is to come.</hi> If thou beeſt a godly man in a Goſpel-ſenſe, that is, one who truly and ſincerely indeavoureth to bee godly. If thou makeſt Gods will,

thy <hi>Rule to live by,</hi> and not thine own, <hi>Gods glory</hi> thy end, and not thy own carnal intereſt. <hi>Gods love</hi> thy <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> If thy <hi>Rules, Aims,</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> bee <hi>godly,</hi> all the Promiſes of this life, and of the life to come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thee.

Gods Commandements (though thou faileſt in all, yet thou haſt reſpect to all) that thou obeyeſt God <hi>in deed,</hi> and <hi>in truth,</hi> and that thou ſincerely laboureſt to bee godly<hi>:</hi> This is a certain ſign, that all the <hi>Promiſes are thy portion;</hi> but you that are ungodly, and do not thoroughly amend your waies, you that ſleight, undervalue, and deſpiſe the <hi>commanding Word,</hi> you have no part, no portion in the <hi>promiſing word.</hi>

                     <hi>proſperity;</hi> For I find by experience that a childe of God <hi>(under outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi> or <hi>divine deſertion,</hi> or <hi>extream melancholy)</hi> is many times like a man in the dark.

Thus I have in three Sermons taught you how to make uſe of <hi>Scripture-promiſes,</hi> as <hi>conduits</hi> of <hi>ſoul-ſupportation,</hi> and <hi>ſoul-conſolation,</hi> in the day of diſtreſs. When you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after read the <hi>Bible,</hi> remember the <hi>promiſing-word,</hi> (as well as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and threatning word) make a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the promiſes, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the <hi>pretiouſneſs, freeneſs, uſefulneſs, latitude, richneſs,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability</hi> of them.

For this purpoſe, ſtudy <hi>theſe thirteen Rules and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Pray unto God to give thee <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eyes,</hi> to ſee thy intereſt in them, and <hi>ſpiritual hands</hi> to reach out after them.

                  <p>There is one Objection behinde, which when I have anſwered, I have done. For a diſtreſſed Chriſtian will object, and ſay,</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>Nay, I muſt adde, That God is not onely a long time <hi>performing</hi> his promiſes, but ſometimes inſtead of <hi>performing</hi> them, hee ſeems to the eye of fleſh and blood to <hi>walk contrary to them.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Providences of God run croſs to his Promiſes.</hi> God promiſed to make <hi>David King;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, hee is perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> as a <hi>Partridge upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> hee is driven to that extremity that hee begins to doubt of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and to ſay, <hi>That one day hee ſhould dye by the hand of Saul.</hi> God promiſed to <hi>Joſeph, That the Sun,</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> At ſuch times there are three things required of us.</p>
                  <p>1 It is our duty to wait <hi>patiently,</hi> and <hi>beleevingly,</hi> till <hi>Providences</hi> and <note place="margin">Three du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to bee practiſed when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences run croſs to promi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170160:131"/>
                     <hi>wait Gods time,</hi> which is the <hi>fitteſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> time, hee will patiently expect, till God fulfil his promiſe. Hee will do as the Martyr did, who might have eſcaped privately out of priſon, and was tempted to it by his friends; But anſwered: <hi>Hee would not go out of priſon when his enemies would have him, for they would make him tarry lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than hee ſhould, nor yet when his friends would have him, for they would make him tarry a leſſer time than hee ſhould; but hee would come out when God would have him.</hi> Gods time is the <hi>beſt;</hi> and they are ſoon enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, who are delivered in <hi>Gods way,</hi> and at <hi>Gods time.</hi> This then is thy great duty (O Chriſtian) to wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and beleevingly, and not to ſeek by unlawful waies to bee rid of thy miſeries, as <hi>David</hi> did by going to the <hi>Philiſtims;</hi> and as many in <hi>Queen</hi>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170160:132"/>
and a good conſcience; you have</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Many rare and precious Promiſes made to thoſe that wait upon him, which I have formerly named.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 You have four attributes in God to ſupport you, his <hi>faithfulneſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſs, infinite goodneſs, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Hee is <hi>faithful,</hi> and not one <hi>tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> of his Word ſhall fall to the ground; hee is <hi>Almighty,</hi> and able to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee hath promiſed; hee is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe,</hi> to know the beſt time and ſeaſon, and infinitely good and loving to his children, and doth not willingly afflict them, but will make <note place="margin">Lam. 3.35</note> haſte to help them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is our duty to live upon <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> while <hi>Providences</hi> ſeem to run croſs to <hi>Promiſes.</hi> This is the meaning of <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> They ſhall <hi>live by Faith,</hi> when they have nothing elſe to <hi>live</hi> on. When ſenſe and reaſon tell them, <hi>they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> then ſhall they <hi>live by Faith</hi> in the Promiſes, and not only live <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,</hi>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:170160:132"/>
but <hi>comfortably,</hi> and <hi>joyfully,</hi> as the ſame Prophet, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19. ſaith, <hi>Although the Fig tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit bee in the Vine, and the field ſhall yeeld no meat, &amp;c. yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> This life did <hi>Paul</hi> live, when the ſhip in which he was, was ready to bee drowned, when <note place="margin">Act. 27. 20, 23, 24</note> there was neither <hi>Sun-light,</hi> nor <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> yet hee was exceedingly chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe <hi>God</hi> had promiſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him, and thoſe with him. By living this life, <hi>God is much honoured,</hi> and our ſouls much quieted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is our duty to <hi>continue praying, till providences and promiſes meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:</hi> For it is prayer, and prayer only, which will at laſt reconcile <hi>Gods Promiſes,</hi> and <hi>Gods diſpenſations,</hi> and cauſe them to <hi>meet,</hi> and to <hi>kiſs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> For as the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> of our <hi>prayers;</hi> ſo our <hi>prayers</hi> are the <hi>divine waies</hi> and <hi>means</hi> for the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170160:133"/>
obtaining of the Promiſes. I ſay as the Promiſes are</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The ground of our prayers. For wee cannot pray in Faith, unleſſe wee have ſome promiſe to bottome our prayers upon; therefore <hi>David</hi> often chargeth God in his prayers with his promiſe. Hee harps eight times upon <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 28, 38, 41, 65, 76, 107, 142, 149.</note> the ſame ſtring in one <hi>Pſalm,</hi> to teach us, that the greateſt <hi>Rethorick and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory we can uſe in our prayers, is to urge God with his promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 They are not only the <hi>ground,</hi> but the <hi>rule of our Prayers;</hi> As wee muſt pray for nothing but what God hath promiſed, ſo wee muſt <hi>regulate</hi> our prayers <hi>according</hi> to Gods Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Thoſe things which hee hath <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely promiſed,</hi> wee muſt pray for <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,</hi> and where God hath put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and exceptions, there our prayers muſt bee conditional.</p>
                  <p>Now as the Promiſes are the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> of our prayers, ſo <hi>our prayers</hi> are <hi>divine means</hi> and <hi>helps</hi> for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170160:133"/>
of the promiſes<hi>:</hi> Though God hath made many glorious and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes to his children, yet hee will perform none of them, but to thoſe who by prayer ſeek them at his hands. When <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> what great things God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him, hee went into <hi>Gods houſe</hi> to pray for them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> mentioneth a glorious promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 25. but hee adds, <hi>Put mee in remembrance,</hi> verſ. 20. Thus <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36. 37. <hi>I will yet for this bee inquired of by the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, and therefore when you read the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Bible, remember whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God makes a <hi>promiſe,</hi> you muſt <hi>make a prayer;</hi> and that <hi>prayer</hi> will haſten the fulfilling of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes<hi>:</hi> You muſt <hi>continue to pray,</hi> and faint not; for the <hi>viſion is but for an appointed time, though it tarry, wait for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 2</note> 
                     <hi>it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry.</hi> This did <hi>Daniel</hi> when hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the time approached, &amp;c.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170160:134"/>
hee prayed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 2. 3. Thus did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 56.9, 10.57. 1, 2. Thus muſt you do. Theſe are the three great duties which the Lord requires of us at all times, but more eſpecially in theſe our daies wherein the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God ſeem to run quite croſs unto his promiſes. The Lord give us grace to practiſe them. So much for this Text.</p>

I ſhall only take notice of her great care and diligence in making <hi>her calling and election ſure.</hi> Shee had not her <hi>Ark</hi> to build when the <hi>flood</hi> came, nor her <hi>Corn</hi> to get when the <hi>ſeven years of Famine</hi> came<hi>:</hi> Shee had laid up a <hi>ſtock</hi> of <hi>graces,</hi> and <hi>comforts</hi> againſt the evil hour; Shee had not her <hi>evidences for Heaven,</hi> to get at the hour of death. But ſhee had collected and compoſed them in the time of her life, and when ſhee came to die, ſhee had neither her <hi>graces,</hi> nor her <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi> nor her <hi>evidences for Heaven</hi> to ſeek, ſhee had nothing to do but to dye.</p>
               <p>Her ſickneſs was very long, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170160:136"/>
very painful, concerning which I ſhall briefly acquaint you with theſe few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>God</hi> moved the hearts of <hi>very many godly people,</hi> to take compaſſion of her ſad and afflicted condition, and to <hi>contribute liberally</hi> (ſhee being poor) towards her relief; this <hi>merciful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> wonderfully comforted her; She ſaw <hi>Gods love</hi> in it, and was ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, that ſhe was (for a little while) really and exceedingly afraid (notwithſtanding her great torments by reaſon of a cancer in her breaſt) leſt ſhe ſhould have her heaven in this life, and leſt this mercy ſhould bee all her portion. The Lord recompence that labour of love and that Chriſtian chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a thouſand fold into the boſomes of thoſe who manifeſted ſo much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to her.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Her <hi>Patience</hi> was very great. As <hi>God</hi> increaſed her <hi>pains,</hi> hee increaſed her patience, even to the admiration of ſuch of us as were frequent ſpectators
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170160:136"/>
of it. She was brought to ſuch a ſweet frame of ſpirit, as to bee <hi>willing to live under all her torments, as long as God pleaſed, and to dye whenſoever he pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Shee was a woman of a very <hi>fearful nature,</hi> and in the time of her health had many <hi>doubts and ſcruples</hi> (notwithſtanding all her care foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) <hi>about her ſalvation.</hi> But in her ſickneſs, all her doubts vaniſhed. <hi>God</hi> chained up <hi>Satan.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> had no power to tempt her, ſhee felt a great <hi>calmneſs</hi> in her ſoul, and had much inward peace, and injoyed more of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>conſolations,</hi> in the time of her <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> than in the time of her <hi>health.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Shee was very forward in <hi>ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>diffuſing</hi> thoſe <hi>graces</hi> which <hi>God</hi> had beſtowed upon her, and in giving <hi>good counſel</hi> to thoſe who viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. I have heard her often, and often perſwading her friends to <hi>prize health,</hi> and to <hi>improve</hi> it for the good of their ſouls, to <hi>lay up</hi> againſt an <hi>evil</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:170160:137"/>
                  <hi>day,</hi> and to <hi>ſtock</hi> themſelves with <hi>grace</hi> before ſickneſs come. Shee would frequently ſay, <hi>O the benefit of health! O prize health! praiſe God for health, and improve health for your eternal good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Shee was very well <hi>verſ't</hi> in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> The Law of God was <hi>her delight;</hi> and this kept her from <hi>periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in <hi>her affliction.</hi> Shee was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fetching cordials out of the Word, to comfort her under her great pains, and to preſerve her from fainting. The twelfth <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was a precious cordial to her, ſo was the eight of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the 2 of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the 4. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and the 17, 18. <hi>verſes. For our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>While wee look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen; for the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:170160:137"/>
                  <hi>are not ſeen are eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Cor. 15. 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For this corruptible muſt put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, and this mortal muſt put on immortality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So when this corruptible ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on immortality; then ſhall bee brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, death is ſwallowed up in victory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thanks bee to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Phil. 3. 21. <hi>Who ſhall change our vile body, that it may bee faſhioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby hee is able even to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things unto himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little before her death ſhee ſaid, <hi>In the Lord Jehovah there is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſtrength;</hi> righteouſneſs for
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170160:138"/>
                  <hi>juſtification</hi> and ſtrength for <hi>ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Shee ſaid, that the <hi>Word of God was the beſt cordial in the world:</hi> And that one <hi>minutes</hi> being in Heaven, would make amends for all <hi>her pain and miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 And laſtly, I cannot but take ſpecial notice of the happy <hi>cloſe</hi> of her life, and of the <hi>bleſſed end</hi> ſhee made. It is ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> James 5. 11. <hi>Yee have heard of the patience of Job,</hi> and <hi>have ſeen the end of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> This our <hi>Chriſtian Siſter</hi> did in a great meaſure, partake both of <hi>Jobs pains,</hi> and <hi>Jobs patience,</hi> and made as happy an end, as hee did, though in another kinde. In the <hi>morning</hi> of that day in which ſhee dyed, ſhee fell into a <hi>ſlumber,</hi> in which ſhee heard (as ſhee thought) one ſaying to her, <hi>This day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.</hi> Immediately ſhee awaked full of joy, and though hardly able to ſpeak, yet ſhee uttered it to thoſe who ſtood by, and was much comforted with it.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170160:138"/>
Now though I am far from putting any confidence in <hi>dreams,</hi> and doubt not <hi>that a man may dream hee ſhall go to Heaven, and yet bee caſt into Hell.</hi> Though I do not think that <hi>comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table dreams</hi> are <hi>ſufficient evidences of ſalvation.</hi> (Nay, when they are brought as proofs of <hi>erronious opinions,</hi> I account them <hi>Diabolical deluſions;</hi> and when wicked men have them, <hi>pleaſant preſumptions.)</hi> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding when a <hi>woman</hi> who hath ſpent many years in the <hi>ſervice of God,</hi> and is viſited by <hi>God</hi> for above a year, with great and moſt grievous pains, ſhall at the cloſe of her life, (when ſhee is upon the very brink of eternity) have ſuch a <hi>ſweet, refreſhing, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chearing impreſſion upon her ſpirit;</hi> when <hi>heart fails,</hi> and <hi>fleſh fails:</hi> When ſhee can hardly ſpeak to expreſs the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her joy, then to hear a voice (as it were) ſaying to her, <hi>This day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.</hi> This (in all probability) was <hi>the voice of</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:170160:139"/>
                  <hi>God, and not of man.</hi> This was <hi>the Lords doing, and it is marveilous in our eyes.</hi> I for bear ſaying any more. Shee is gone from a <hi>priſon,</hi> to a <hi>palace;</hi> from a <hi>purgatory,</hi> to a <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Shee is at <hi>reſt with God, where all tears are wiped away from her eyes:</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> fit us by <hi>has grace,</hi> to follow her in due time into the <hi>Kingdome of glory:</hi> Amen.</p>

and this I ſhall make to appear in five or ſix particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Lord by his Spirit accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the preaching of his Word, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſcales to fall from my eyes, and opened them, and ſet up a clear light in my underſtanding, and made mee to ſee <hi>ſin,</hi> to bee <hi>exceeding ſinful,</hi> out of meaſure ſinful, and to look on it as the loathſomeſt thing in the world, and on my ſelf as a loathſome creature in Gods ſight, and in my own ſight, by reaſon of the Leproſie of ſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was over-run.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Lord brought mee to ſee the <hi>miſery</hi> that I was in, by reaſon of my ſins. I thought I was utterly forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, and I thought that God would never accept of ſuch a wretch as I ſaw my ſelf to bee. I could not think otherwiſe, but that hell was my portion, and that I, by reaſon of my ſins muſt go thither, expecting every day when the Lord would glorifie himſelf in my damnation. I ſaw my
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170160:142"/>
ſelf in more miſery, becauſe of my ſins than I could then, or now expreſſe to any body. I looked upon God as a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> and on my ſelf as <hi>ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> ready to bee <hi>conſumed</hi> by him, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Lord brought mee to a <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual astoniſhment,</hi> that I cried out, <hi>What ſhall I do to bee ſaved!</hi> and ſaid with <hi>Paul, Lord! what wouldeſt thou have mee to do?</hi> Do but make known to thy poor creature what thy will is, and I thought I could do any thing, or ſuffer any thing for the Lord. But ſince I have had ſome more knowledge of the holy Will of God, woe is mee! what a barren and unfruitful heart have I! a heart that can neither do, nor ſuffer any thing for the Lord, as I ought to do: But this I can ſay, that the <hi>aſtoniſhment</hi> I was in by the <hi>ſight</hi> of my <hi>ſins,</hi> and the <hi>miſery</hi> I was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into, put mee on the <hi>performance of holy duties,</hi> eſpecially <hi>prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 The Lord took mee off my own
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170160:142"/>
                     <hi>bottome,</hi> off my own <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and made mee to ſee that that was but a <hi>ſandy foundation,</hi> and would not hold out. I was not taken off from the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> of holy duties; no, I thought with my ſelf that I am commanded by God to perform holy duties, which is the way and means whereby wee may meet with God (For hee is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to bee injoyed no where but in his own ordinances) but the Lord took mee off from <hi>reſting</hi> and <hi>truſting</hi> in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. And as hee made mee to ſee that without the practiſe of them hee would not accept of mee; ſo alſo hee made mee to know that it was not for holy duties, for which I was accepted. The ſins that cleave to my beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, are enough for which the Lord may juſtly condemn mee, if I had no other ſins.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The Lord brought mee to ſee a <hi>Superlative beauty</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> in the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and my ſoul was deeply in love with him, even with
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170160:143"/>
                     <hi>whole</hi> Chriſt, in all his <hi>offices,</hi> and (if I know any thing at all of my own heart) I deſired Chriſt as much to bee my <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Prophet;</hi> to teach, and guide mee, and ſubdue mee to himſelf, and rule over mee, as to bee my <hi>High-Priest,</hi> to make atonement by offering up of himſelf for mee, and waſhing mee in his blood, by which I muſt bee juſtified.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The Lord brought mee to ſee a <hi>ſoul-ſatisfaction</hi> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>alone;</hi> and I think I ſhould bee as fully ſatisfied with Chriſt alone, as my heart can deſire. If I know my heart, it panteth after Chriſt, and Chriſt alone: <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt.</hi> The whole world in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,</hi> or <hi>competition</hi> with Chriſt, is nothing to mee: But in him I ſee full contentment. To ſee and know my intereſt in him, and to injoy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, is that, which if the Lord would beſtow upon mee, I ſhould with <hi>Jacob</hi> ſay, <hi>it is enough;</hi> and with old

                  </p>
                  <p>Now I deſire to ſet down ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture Evidences, that I finde upon ſearch and examination of my heart, by laying it to the Rule; The Word of God.</p>

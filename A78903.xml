            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>U≈øe.</hi> This ≈øhews that there are but few <hi>true Saints</hi> among≈øt us.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170160:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make the word of God his darling and delights.</p>
               <p>But where ≈øhall wee finde ≈øuch Saints?

Au≈øtin</hi> profe≈ø≈øeth of him≈øelf, that <hi>before his conver≈øion,</hi> hee took no plea≈øure in the word of God.

They can delight in the gifts of God, in riches, and health, and honours: But they cannot delight in the God of the≈øe gifts.

               <p>It is certain that they are not <hi>born anew,</hi> for if they were new born babes, they would de≈øire the ≈øincere milk of the word.</p>
               <p>It is certain that the <hi>Law of God</hi> is not yet <hi>written in their hearts,</hi> and that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth not dwell in them.

There is no condition (but one) that a man can bee in, but hee may finde ≈øoul ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting comfort for it our of the Word.

For it is the <hi>Word</hi> of that <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>God of all con≈øolation.</hi> There is no kinde of true comfort, but here it is to bee had, here are cordials of all ≈øorts.

               <p n="2">2 The Word of God is not only the <hi>Magazin</hi> of all true comfort, but the <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence it is derived. All the comfort that you receive by reading of good books, is fetcht out of this book. All the refre≈øhings that the <hi>Amba≈øsadors</hi> of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter to you, are borrowed from this <hi>Fountain.</hi> As the King of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered the woman (that cryed out, ≈øaying, <hi>Help my Lord O King) If the</hi>

               <p n="3">3 It will comfort us <hi>at ≈øuch a time,</hi> when no outward thing can comfort us.

               <p n="4">4 <hi>The Comforts</hi> of the <hi>Word exceed</hi> all other <hi>comforts,</hi> for they are <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>purifying, ≈øure,</hi> and <hi>≈øatisfying;</hi> they are <hi>≈øoul-≈øupporting, ≈øoul-comforting,</hi> and <hi>≈øoul-ravi≈øhing;</hi> they are <hi>durable</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting.</hi> The comforts of the world are not worthy to bee named that day, in which wee ≈øpeak of the

comforts of the Word. They are not <hi>con≈øolationes,</hi> but <hi>con≈øolatiunculae.</hi> At be≈øt they are but <hi>bodily, un≈øatisfying,</hi> and <hi>tran≈øitory.</hi> Many times they are ≈øinful, and ≈øoul-damning.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The Word of God is not only a <hi>Magazin,</hi> and a <hi>Fountain</hi> of comfort, but al≈øo a <hi>touch-≈øtone,</hi> by which wee mu≈øt trie all our comforts, whether they bee true and real, or no. All joyes, hopes, and a≈ø≈øurances, mu≈øt be tried by the Word, and if not rightly grounded thereupon, are fal≈øe, and ≈øoul-delu≈øions.</p>
               <p n="6">6 It is as an <hi>Apothecaries ≈øhop,</hi> or a <hi>Phy≈øitians di≈øpen≈øatory,</hi> out of which wee may fetch all manner of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi> to cure all the di≈øea≈øes of our <hi>≈øouls.</hi> Art thou ≈øpiritually lame, blinde, or dumb? &amp;c. The Word will open blinde eyes, make the dumb to ≈øpeak, and the lame to walk. If dead in ≈øins and tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes, the Word, when it is the ≈øword of the ≈øpirit, will quicken thee.

               </p>
               <p n="7">7 It is a <hi>≈øpiritual Armory;</hi> out of which wee may fetch all manner of weapons, to conquer the Devil, and his temptations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. It is that <hi>little brook,</hi> out of which every <hi>David</hi> may fetch <hi>five ≈ømooth ≈øtones</hi> to de≈øtroy the Devil.

               <p n="8">8 It is the <hi>Sun of the Chri≈øtian world.</hi> As the <hi>Sun</hi> is the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>natural world,</hi> and without it, the world is but a Chaos, and a dungeon full of darkne≈øs. So is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>≈øpiritual world,</hi> without which a Chri≈øtian is under an eternal night.

What would all the world avail, if no Sun to illighten it, and what comfort would all the wealth of it afford us, if, no word to in≈øtruct, and coun≈øel us? For this is the Chri≈øtians compa≈øs to ≈øail to Heaven by, his ≈øtaffe to walk withal to Heaven, his ≈øpiritual bladders to keep his ≈øoul from drowning. The Cork, to keep up the net of his ≈øoul from ≈øinking. Afflictions are like the <hi>lead</hi> of the net, which weigheth it down, but the <hi>Word</hi> is as the <hi>Cork,</hi> which keeps it up, that it ≈øinks not.

may both of them read the ≈øame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hear the ≈øame Sermon, and one of them may have his troubled minde pacified, and the other continue troubled, and the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe the Spirit of God makes the Word <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to one,</hi> and <hi>not to the other.</hi> How often hath a di≈øtre≈ø≈øed Saint, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 27, 28. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 26.3. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 57. 15, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. and found no comfort in reading of them; But if the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> did <hi>come in,</hi> and open his eyes to behold the <hi>rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> wrapt up in the≈øe promi≈øes, and <hi>his intere≈øt</hi> in them, they would fill him with comfort above expre≈ø≈øion.

of the promi≈øes<hi>:</hi> Though God hath made many glorious and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promi≈øes to his children, yet hee will perform none of them, but to tho≈øe who by prayer ≈øeek them at his hands.

very painful, concerning which I ≈øhall briefly acquaint you with the≈øe few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>God</hi> moved the hearts of <hi>very many godly people,</hi> to take compa≈ø≈øion of her ≈øad and afflicted condition, and to <hi>contribute liberally</hi> (≈øhee being poor) towards her relief; this <hi>merciful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> wonderfully comforted her; She ≈øaw <hi>Gods love</hi> in it, and was ≈øo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, that ≈øhe was (for a little while) really and exceedingly afraid (notwith≈øtanding her great torments by rea≈øon of a cancer in her brea≈øt) le≈øt ≈øhe ≈øhould have her heaven in this life, and le≈øt this mercy ≈øhould bee all her portion.

of it. She was brought to ≈øuch a ≈øweet frame of ≈øpirit, as to bee <hi>willing to live under all her torments, as long as God plea≈øed, and to dye when≈øoever he plea≈øed.</hi>

               <p n="5">5 Shee was very well <hi>ver≈ø't</hi> in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> The Law of God was <hi>her delight;</hi> and this kept her from <hi>peri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in <hi>her affliction.</hi> Shee was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fetching cordials out of the Word, to comfort her under her great pains, and to pre≈øerve her from fainting.

and ground my hope, that God loveth mee; according to that Scripture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Wee love him, becau≈øe hee fir≈øt loved us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I finde my heart much inflamed <label type="milestone">
